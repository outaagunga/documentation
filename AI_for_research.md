**AI-Powered Online Research Workflow**

**Step 1: Define Your Research Goal**

* What do you want to know?
* Example: “How does social media affect student learning?”

---

**Step 2: Generate Keywords with AI**

* Ask AI: *“Suggest 5–10 keywords or search phrases for [your topic].”*
* Example keywords: *“social media and education,” “impact of TikTok on study habits,” “digital distraction in students.”*

---

**Step 3: Collect Sources Online**

* Use search engines (Google, Bing, or Scholar) with the keywords.
* Save links, PDFs, or copy short sections.
* Tip: Use quotation marks (“...”) for exact phrases.

---

**Step 4: Use AI to Process Sources**

* Paste a paragraph, article, or link into AI. Ask:

  * *“Summarize this in simple terms.”*
  * *“What are the 3 main points?”*
  * *“Explain this like I’m a beginner.”*
* Compare multiple sources by pasting them and asking: *“What are the similarities and differences?”*

---

**Step 5: Check Source Credibility**

* Ask AI: *“Is this source credible? Who published it?”*
* Double-check on the site (is it from a journal, government, or random blog?).

---

**Step 6: Organize Your Findings**

* Ask AI: *“Create an outline from my notes.”*
* Structure:

  1. Introduction (topic + purpose)
  2. Key Findings (group by theme)
  3. Comparison (different views)
  4. Conclusion

---

**Step 7: Create Your Output**  
How do you want the final output to look like
* Ask AI: *“Turn my notes into a 1-page summary / essay / report / slides/comparison table.”*
* Always **add your own words** so it’s personalized and authentic.

---

**Step 8: Review & Final Check**

* Verify facts with at least 2 reliable sources.
* Ask AI: *“What information might be missing from my research?”*
* Revise your draft with your own analysis.

---

**Quick Prompts You Can Reuse**

* *“Suggest keywords for researching [topic].”*
* *“Summarize this article in bullet points.”*
* *“Explain this text in simple language.”*
* *“Compare the findings from these two sources.”*
* *“Create a research outline on [topic].”*
* *“Draft a short report using my notes.”*

## Core Research Tasks You Can Automate with AI

AI can help you with all the time-consuming parts of traditional online research:

### 1. Quick Summaries and Overviews

If you need to learn about a new topic, an AI can give you a comprehensive overview much faster than reading multiple articles.

* **Prompt Idea:**  
```bash
  "Explain the concept of 'quantum computing' to a high school student and list the top three companies currently developing it. Please cite your sources."
```
**Result:** A clear, simplified explanation, followed by a list of companies and verifiable links to where the information was found.

### 2. Compare and Contrast Information

Instead of opening multiple tabs to compare products or concepts, ask the AI to do it for you.

* **Prompt Idea:**
```bash
"I am trying to buy a new smart phone for under kshs 15,000. Create a comparison table between Sumsang Galaxy A16 and Oppo A3X. Compare them on Price, Battery Life, Memory, Pixels rating from a reputable tech site."
```
**Result:** A clean, easy-to-read table with key data points and the source link for the review.

### 3. Analyze and Explain Complex Documents (PDFs/Webpages)

Many AI tools allow you to upload a document or paste a long article/URL and ask questions about it. This is great for academic papers or long reports.

* **Prompt Idea:**  
```bash
"I have uploaded a 50-page industry report. Read it and summarize the key market trends for the next 5 years into 5 bullet points. Also, what is the main risk identified in the report?"
```
**Result:** The AI extracts and synthesizes the core information, saving you hours of reading.

### 4. Organize Your Findings

AI can help structure your notes or create outlines for reports.

* **Prompt Idea:**
```bash
  "I've been researching the history of the Eiffel Tower. Create a 4-section outline for a presentation: 1. Conception and Design, 2. The 1889 World's Fair, 3. Role in the 20th Century, 4. Modern Significance."
```
**Result:** A structured, detailed outline that helps you see how to organize your collected facts.

## Step 4: The Beginner's Golden Rule: **Always Verify!**

AI is an assistant, not a final authority. Because AI models can sometimes "hallucinate" (make up facts or citations), you must verify the information.

1.  **Look for Citations:** Prioritize AI tools that provide clickable links or citations next to their answers.
2.  **Click the Link:** Click on the source links provided by the AI. You should be able to quickly see that the source backs up the AI's claim. If the source is an unknown blog, you might want to find a more reputable one.
3.  **Cross-Reference:** If you find a surprising or important fact, try running a quick traditional Google search to see if other reputable sources confirm it.

By using simple, specific prompts and always double-checking the sources, you can use AI to become a very efficient and effective online researcher!
