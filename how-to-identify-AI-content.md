# Common Tells That Make AI-Generated Content Easier to Spot

---

## 1. Overly balanced sentence structure

AI loves symmetry and formula.

Examples:

* “Not only X, but also Y.”
* “This is important because A, B, and C.”

Human writing is messier. People interrupt themselves, change direction mid-thought, or trail off.

---

## 2. Grammar that’s *too* perfect

AI almost never:

* Misses articles (“a,” “the”)
* Uses fragments naturally
* Breaks rules for emphasis

Humans do:

* “This thing? Not great.”
* “Honestly… didn’t expect that.”

---

## 3. Excessive clarity and completeness

AI explains *everything*, even when it doesn’t need to.

Example:

> “This is due to several factors, including…”

Humans assume shared context and skip steps.

---

## 4. Neutral, polite, corporate tone

AI defaults to being:

* Calm
* Helpful
* Diplomatic
* Inoffensive

Humans:

* Take sides
* Get annoyed
* Sound unsure
* Let emotion leak unevenly

---

## 5. Repetitive phrasing patterns

Watch for recycled sentence starters:

* “It is important to note that…”
* “In today’s world…”
* “This highlights the need for…”

Humans repeat *ideas*, not phrasing.

---

## 6. Suspiciously well-structured lists

AI loves:

* 5–7 bullet points
* Parallel grammar
* Even length

Human lists are messy:

* Too long
* Too short
* One bullet that doesn’t quite fit

---

## 7. Lack of strong personal opinion

AI hedges:

* “It can be argued that…”
* “There are differing perspectives…”

Humans say:

* “This is nonsense.”
* “I hated this part.”
* “Honestly, I don’t buy it.”

---

## 8. Generic examples

AI examples tend to be:

* Safe
* Broad
* Non-specific

Humans mention:

* Odd details
* Names
* Niche or slightly random situations

---

## 9. No real uncertainty

AI sounds confident—even when wrong.

Humans:

* Correct themselves mid-sentence
* Say “I think” and actually mean it
* Leave thoughts unfinished

---

## 10. Predictable rhythm

AI paragraphs often:

* Start strong
* Develop logically
* End neatly

Humans sometimes:

* Ramble
* Jump topics
* End abruptly

---

## 11. Buzzword overload

AI overuses “sophisticated-sounding” words.

Common favorites:
**Verbs:** delve, underscore, leverage, enhance, navigate
**Adjectives:** pivotal, robust, comprehensive, multifaceted

Also watch for clichés like:

* “A rich tapestry…”
* “The broader landscape…”
* “A testament to…”

---

## 12. Low “burstiness” (sentence variety)

Human writing mixes:

* Short punches
* Long rambles
* Fragments

AI sentences tend to be similar in length and structure, creating a smooth but monotonous rhythm.

---

## 13. Excessive transitions and signposting

AI over-connects ideas with:

* “Furthermore”
* “Moreover”
* “In addition”
* “Consequently”

Classic tell: a final paragraph starting with

> “In conclusion,” “Ultimately,” or “To wrap up…”

---

## 14. Morphological clues (how words are used)

Recent studies (2025–2026) show consistent patterns:

* **Heavy nominalization:**
  “The implementation of the strategy” vs. “Implementing the strategy”
* **Overuse of present participles:**
  “…sat on the mat, staring at the door”
* **Avoidance of first-person:**
  AI defaults to detached third-person unless prompted

---

## 15. Emotional flatness and hedging

AI is designed to be “safe,” which results in:

* Forced balance (“on the one hand…”)
* Vague adjectives (“important,” “exciting”)
* No gritty detail or lived experience

Humans pick sides and live with it.

---

## 16. Punctuation tells

Common giveaways:

* Heavy, correct use of em dashes (—)
* Consistent Oxford commas in casual writing
* Immaculate spacing and punctuation
* Neatly wrapped conclusions that restate the obvious

---

### Quick rule of thumb

If the writing feels:

* **Too clean**
* **Too calm**
* **Too evenly smart**

…it’s probably AI.
