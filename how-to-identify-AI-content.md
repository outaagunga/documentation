# common tells that make AI-generated content easier to spot:

---

## 1. **Overly balanced sentence structure**

AI loves symmetry.

* “Not only X, but also Y.”
* “This is important because A, B, and C.”

Humans mix it up more, interrupt themselves, or trail off.

---

## 2. **Too perfect grammar (even when it shouldn’t be)**

AI rarely:

* Misses articles (“a”, “the”)
* Uses informal fragments naturally
* Breaks rules for emphasis

Humans do things like:

* “This thing? Not great.”
* “Honestly… didn’t expect that.”

---

## 3. **Excessive clarity and completeness**

AI explains *everything*, even when unnecessary.

Example:

> “This is because of several factors, including…”

Humans often assume shared context and skip steps.

---

## 4. **Neutral, polite, corporate tone**

AI defaults to:

* Calm
* Helpful
* Inoffensive
* Diplomatic

Humans:

* Take sides
* Get annoyed
* Sound unsure
* Use emotion unevenly

---

## 5. **Repetitive phrasing patterns**

Watch for recycled sentence starters:

* “It is important to note that…”
* “In today’s world…”
* “This highlights the need for…”

Humans repeat ideas, not phrasing.

---

## 6. **Lists that are suspiciously well-structured**

AI loves:

* 5–7 bullet points
* Even lengths
* Parallel grammar

Humans make messy lists:

* Too long
* Too short
* One bullet that doesn’t fit

---

## 7. **Lack of strong personal opinion**

AI hedges:

* “It can be argued that…”
* “There are differing perspectives…”

Humans say:

* “This is nonsense.”
* “I hated this part.”
* “Honestly, I don’t buy it.”

---

## 8. **Generic examples**

AI examples are:

* Safe
* Broad
* Non-specific

Humans mention:

* Odd details
* Names
* Situations that feel random or niche

---

## 9. **No real uncertainty**

AI sounds confident even when wrong.

Humans:

* Correct themselves mid-sentence
* Say “I think” and actually mean it
* Leave thoughts unfinished

---

## 10. **Predictable rhythm**

AI paragraphs often:

* Start strong
* Develop logically
* End neatly

Humans sometimes:

* Ramble
* Jump topics
* End abruptly

---

### Quick rule of thumb

If the writing feels:

* **Too clean**
* **Too calm**
* **Too evenly smart**

…it’s probably AI.

1. The "Buzzword" OverloadAI has a strange obsession with certain "flavor" words that sound sophisticated but are rarely used so frequently by humans. If you see these words appearing multiple times in a short text, it’s a high-probability AI signal:Verb favorites: Delve, underscore, transcend, foster, leverage, enhance, navigate.Adjective favorites: Pivotal, robust, intricate, comprehensive, vibrant, multifaceted.The "Tapestry" Trope: AI loves describing things as a "tapestry," "landscape," or "testament to..."2. Low "Burstiness" (Sentence Variety)Human writing is "bursty"—we mix short, punchy sentences with long, rambling ones. We use fragments for effect. We get distracted.AI Pattern: AI tends to produce sentences of a very similar length and structure throughout a paragraph. This creates a rhythmic "drone" that feels consistent but lacks the natural ebb and flow of human thought.3. Excessive Transitional PhrasesBecause AI is designed to be helpful and logical, it over-explains the connection between ideas. It relies heavily on "signposting" words:"Furthermore," "Moreover," "In addition," "Additionally," and "Consequently."The Conclusion Formula: AI almost always starts a final paragraph with "In conclusion," "Ultimately," or "To wrap up," followed by a neat summary of everything it just said.4. Morphological IndicatorsRecent studies from 2025 and 2026 show that AI and humans use different "parts of speech" at different rates:Nominalization: AI uses significantly more nouns and "noun-heavy" phrases (e.g., "The implementation of the strategy" vs. the human "Implementing the strategy").Present Participial Clauses: AI loves sentences like: "The cat sat on the mat, staring at the door." It uses this structure ($verb+ing$) up to 5 times more often than humans.Lack of First-Person: Unless specifically asked, AI tends to avoid "I" or "my," opting for a neutral, detached third-person perspective.5. Emotional "Flatness" and "Hedging"AI is programmed to be "safe," which results in a lack of strong opinions or "hot takes."The "Balanced" View: AI will almost always give you a "on the one hand, on the other hand" response even when a human would just pick a side.Vague Adjectives: It uses generic positive adjectives (like "exciting" or "important") without providing the specific, gritty details or personal anecdotes that a human would share.

2. Use of em dashes  

1. **Em dashes (—)** excessively and correctly
2. **A comma before “and”** (Oxford comma) even in informal writing
3. **Overly complete sentences** with perfect grammar
4. **Balanced, formulaic sentence structures** (not only X, but also Y)
5. **Repetitive transition phrases** (however, moreover, in addition)
6. **Neutral, cautious tone** with excessive hedging
7. **Well-aligned bullet lists** with parallel wording
8. **Generic examples** lacking specific or personal detail
9. **Consistent punctuation and spacing** throughout
10. **Neatly wrapped conclusions** that restate the obvious
