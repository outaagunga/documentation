# How to pass online interviews with the help of AI e.g ChatGPT  
### **1. Prepare Before the Interview**

* Copy the **project description** and **responsibilities** from the job platform e.g Mercor.
* Paste them into ChatGPT and ask it to:

  * Generate a tailored résumé
  * Predict likely interview questions
  * Give sample answers
  * Create a cheat sheet you can refer to during the interview.

### **2. Create a Quick-Reference Notes Page**

Ask ChatGPT to generate:

* Short bullet answers
* Key definitions
* 1–2 sentence explanations
* Your project story/script

Keep this open during the interview.

### **3. During the Interview**

The Mercor AI interviewer usually asks predictable, structured questions such as:

* “Tell me about yourself.”
* “Describe your experience with X skill.”
* “How would you solve X problem?”
* “Walk me through your approach…”

Before answering, you can:

* Quickly copy the question
* Paste into ChatGPT
* Request: “Give me a concise answer in 2–4 sentences based on my résumé.”

This gives you a Cluely-like experience—**but with better answers**.

### **4. Answer Naturally**

Don’t paste verbatim.
Do this instead:

* Skim the answer ChatGPT gives you
* Speak it out in your own tone
* Adjust on the fly so it sounds human

Mercor AI checks consistency and clarity—not whether the answer is “perfect.”

📈## Technical Auditing Knowledge

### 6. What are the main stages of the internal audit process?  
The main stages are:

> Planning – understanding the auditee, defining objectives, and developing the audit plan.

> Fieldwork – gathering evidence through testing, interviews, and document review.

> Reporting – summarizing findings and recommendations.

> Follow-up – verifying implementation of recommendations.

### 7. What is the difference between internal and external auditing?  
> Internal auditing focuses on evaluating and improving internal controls, risk management, and governance for management’s use. External auditing provides an independent opinion on financial statements for external stakeholders. Internal auditors are employees; external auditors are independent professionals.

### 8. Explain the types of internal audits.
> Operational audit: evaluates efficiency and effectiveness of operations.

> Compliance audit: ensures adherence to laws, policies, and regulations.

> Financial audit: verifies accuracy of financial information.

> Information systems audit: reviews IT controls and data integrity.

> Performance audit: assesses whether resources are used economically and effectively.

### 9. What is risk-based auditing?
> Risk-based auditing prioritizes audit activities based on the level of risk exposure. It focuses resources on areas with the highest potential for error, fraud, or inefficiency, ensuring the audit adds the most value.

### 10. How do you assess the effectiveness of internal controls?
> I start by understanding the control design, testing how it operates, and comparing it against the intended objective. This involves walkthroughs, document review, sample testing, and evaluating whether controls prevent or detect risks on a timely basis.

### 11. What is materiality in auditing?
> Materiality is the threshold above which a misstatement or control weakness could influence users’ decisions. It helps auditors focus on significant areas that impact the organization’s objectives or financial position.

### 12. What is the importance of an audit trail?
> An audit trail provides evidence of all transactions and actions taken, ensuring transparency, accountability, and traceability during audits or investigations.

### 13. Explain “substantive testing” and “compliance testing.”

> Substantive testing: checks accuracy and completeness of records (e.g., verifying transactions).

> Compliance testing: checks whether internal controls are followed (e.g., checking if approvals exist).

### 14. How do you ensure your audit evidence is sufficient and appropriate?
> By using multiple methods—inspection, observation, inquiry, and analytical procedures—and ensuring evidence is relevant, reliable, and obtained from independent sources when possible.

## Standards, Ethics, and Governance

### 15. What are the key principles of the IIA Code of Ethics?

### 16. What do you understand by independence and objectivity in internal auditing?
> Independence means the audit function is free from interference in determining scope and reporting. Objectivity means auditors perform their work without bias or conflict of interest, ensuring findings are based solely on evidence.

### 17. What is the purpose of an internal audit charter?
> It defines the internal audit’s mission, authority, and responsibility. It formally authorizes access to records, personnel, and physical properties relevant to audit engagements.

### 18. How do you handle ethical dilemmas during an audit?
> I refer to the IIA Code of Ethics, maintain transparency with my supervisor, and document the facts objectively. If necessary, I escalate the issue to the audit committee or ethics office for guidance.

⚙️## Risk Management and Control

### 19. How do you identify and assess organizational risks?
> I review strategic objectives, interview management, analyze financial and operational data, and use risk matrices to evaluate likelihood and impact. This helps prioritize key audit areas.

### 20. Give an example of a time you helped management mitigate a major risk.
> In my previous role, I identified weak segregation of duties in the payment process. I recommended system-based approval limits and workflow controls. After implementation, unauthorized payments reduced significantly.

### 21. How do you prioritize audit areas in your annual plan?
> I use a risk-based approach — ranking departments or processes based on risk exposure, control maturity, and financial significance. High-risk areas receive priority in the audit plan.

📊## Data Analysis and Technology in Auditing

### 22. Which audit tools or software have you used?
> I’ve used Microsoft Excel for data analysis, ACL for sampling and testing, and Power BI for visual dashboards. I also use document management tools for audit trail tracking.

### 23. How can data analytics improve internal audit efficiency?
> It allows continuous monitoring, quicker detection of anomalies, and testing of 100% of transactions rather than small samples—leading to more accurate findings and timely insights.

### 24. How would you audit an IT system?
> I would assess system access controls, data backup and recovery, change management, and segregation of duties. I’d also verify that user permissions match job roles and that cybersecurity controls are effective.

🧩## Fraud Detection and Investigation

### 25. What are key indicators of fraud?
> Unusual transactions, missing documentation, employees unwilling to take leave, duplicate payments, or unexplained variances in accounts.

### 26. Describe how you would investigate suspected fraud.
> I’d first gather facts discreetly, preserve evidence, review transactions, interview relevant staff, and maintain confidentiality. If confirmed, I’d report through the appropriate channels, such as audit committee or ethics office.

### 27. How do you maintain confidentiality during investigations?
> By limiting information to authorized personnel, securing documents, and ensuring all discussions remain professional and evidence-based.

📈## Reporting and Communication

### 28. How do you write an audit report that management will act upon?

> I use an audit schedule with clear milestones, prioritize high-risk areas, and communicate proactively with the team to stay on track.

### 33. Have you ever disagreed with your supervisor or audit client?
> Yes, but I handled it professionally by presenting my evidence objectively and respecting differing opinions. In one case, further review confirmed my assessment, strengthening trust.

### 34. Tell us about a time you improved an audit process.
> I introduced an Excel-based risk matrix that streamlined planning and scoring. This reduced planning time and improved audit consistency across departments.

🧾## Financial and Accounting

### 35. Explain the difference between accrual and cash accounting.
> Accrual accounting recognizes income and expenses when they are earned or incurred, while cash accounting records them when cash is received or paid.
