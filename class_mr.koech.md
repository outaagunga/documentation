*(For Beginners and Students Writing APA-Style Papers)*

---

### **STEP 1: Choose a General Area of Interest**

Start by selecting a broad topic that genuinely interests you.
Examples: *Climate Change*, *Social Media Use*, *Mental Health in Schools*, *Artificial Intelligence in Education*, or *Gender Equality in the Workplace.*

✅ **Action:** Write your chosen general topic in this format:

> My general topic is: _______________________

---

### **STEP 2: Generate Specific Research Questions**

Ask AI to narrow your topic into focused, researchable questions.
Use this prompt:

> “As an academic research assistant, provide 5 potential, specific research questions in the field of [Your General Topic] that are suitable for a [Your Paper Length/Level, e.g., 10-page undergraduate] paper. The questions should address a current gap in the literature.”

✅ **Action:**

* Review the AI’s list carefully.
* Select one research question that you find most interesting and feasible.

> I have chosen this research question: _______________________

---

### **STEP 3: Develop Your Thesis Statement**  
After Identifying Your Research Question  
Example:

> “How is climate change affecting food security in sub-Saharan Africa?”

---

**Brainstorm What You Already Know**
Imagine a friend just asked you this question in a conversation.

* What comes to mind first?
* What do you already know or think about it?

**Hint:**
If you know very little, do a quick Google search.

* Copy and paste your research question into the search bar.
* Read one or two credible summaries or short articles (avoid deep reports).
* Find a clear, simple, and factual idea to start from.

---

**Write a Simple Answer using your own words**
In your own words, write one or two sentences that express your first opinion or logical guess about the question.

Example:

> “I think climate change threatens food security in sub-Saharan Africa by reducing crop yields and making rainfall unpredictable.”

This is your **preliminary answer or hypothesis**.

---

**Then, use AI to refine it into a strong thesis statement:**  

> “I have chosen the research question: [Your Selected Question]. My preliminary answer/stance is that [Your Preliminary Answer]. Refine this into a strong, clear, and argumentative thesis statement suitable for an APA-style academic paper.”

✅ **Action:**

* Paste your thesis statement below after AI refinement.

> My final thesis statement: _______________________

---

### **STEP 4: Create the APA-Style Paper Structure**

Ask AI to help you build the skeleton of your research paper using the standard APA structure.
Use this prompt:

> “Generate a detailed, multi-level outline (using Roman numerals, capital letters, and Arabic numerals) for a research paper on the topic: [Your Thesis Statement]. The structure must follow the standard APA paper format: Title Page, Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review (with 3 key themes), Methodology (if applicable), Discussion, Conclusion, and References.”

✅ **Action:**

* Save the generated outline.
* You’ll use this as your roadmap for the entire paper.

---

### **STEP 5: Generate Search Keywords for Academic Sources**

Before searching databases, create a list of search terms that match your topic.
Use this AI prompt:

> “Based on my thesis: [Your Thesis Statement], generate a list of 10–15 key academic keywords and phrases I should use to search for scholarly articles and empirical studies.”

**List of Keywords Generated**
> * 1st Keyword: __________________
> * 2nd Keyword: __________________
> * 3rd Keyword: __________________
> * 4th Keyword: __________________


✅ **Action:**

* Use the suggested keywords to search in:

  * Google Scholar ([https://scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com))
  * Semantic Scholar ([https://www.semanticscholar.org](https://www.semanticscholar.org))
  * Your university library databases

Save or download at least **5–10 high-quality, peer-reviewed articles** in PDF format.
**Hint: You can just save the link to each source instead of pdf**
* Source One: ___________________________
* Source Two: ___________________________
* Source Three: _________________________
* Source Four:  _________________________
---

### **STEP 6: Understand and Summarize Each Source**

When you read your sources, you may not fully understand every section. Use AI for clarification or summarization.
Prompt:

> “I am writing a literature review. Summarize the main argument and key findings of this text (or uploaded PDF) in 3–4 concise, academically toned sentences. Highlight how the findings relate to [Your Specific Research Question/Theme].”

✅ **Action:**

* Summarize each article in your own words.
* Create a simple table or note sheet with: Author, Year, Key Findings, Relevance to Your Question.
  
| Name of Author(s) | Year | Key Findings | Relevance to Research Question |
|--------------------|------|---------------|--------------------------------|
|                    |      |               |                                |
|                    |      |               |                                |
|                    |      |               |                                |

### **STEP 7: Write the Literature Review Section**

Use your summaries to build the Literature Review around 2–3 main themes.
To make transitions smoother, use AI for synthesis.
Prompt:
