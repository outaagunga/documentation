# Recornition of prior learning by NITA (RPL)
## 🎥 PART 1 — Best Way to Record the Videos

## ✅ Option A — Screen Recording (BEST — most professional)

Use screen recording software so assessors see your actual actions.

### Good free tools (Windows)

* **OBS Studio** ⭐ (best overall, professional quality)
* **Xbox Game Bar** (Win + Alt + R — super simple)
* **Clipchamp Screen Recorder** (built into newer Windows)

👉 I strongly recommend **OBS Studio** if you can learn it (very simple once set up).

### OBS Quick Setup

1. Install OBS Studio
2. Open → click **+ under Sources**
3. Choose **Display Capture**
4. Add **Audio Input Capture** (your microphone)
5. Click **Start Recording**

---

## ✅ Recording Tips (Important for Assessment)

* Turn ON microphone and **explain what you’re doing**
* Zoom screen to **125–150%** so text is readable
* Close personal files & notifications
* Record in **one continuous session** per task
* Speak slowly like a trainer teaching a student
* Keep mouse movements calm and intentional
* Show:

  * Opening the program
  * Saving the file
  * Naming the file properly

---

## 🎤 What Assessors Want to See

They’re not just testing software — they want proof you understand workflow:

✔ Planning
✔ Creating from scratch
✔ Formatting
✔ Saving correctly
✔ Using correct tools
✔ Confidence & independence

Love this — having a clear speaking script will make your videos sound confident, structured, and very “assessment-ready.” 👍🏽
I’ll give you **natural, professional scripts** you can read or slightly adapt. They’re written so you sound like someone demonstrating real competence — not just clicking randomly.

👉 Tip before we start:
Don’t sound robotic. Practice once or twice so it flows naturally.
