### Prompt 3: Developing a Critical Eye
I want to develop my critical thinking skills by analyzing a solution together. Let's examine this solution you provided:

[Paste AI's suggested solution]

My initial assessment:

- Strengths I see: [What you think is good about the solution]

- Concerns I have: [Any aspects you're unsure about]

- Questions that came to mind: [1-2 specific questions you have]

Could we collaborate on a critical review where:

1. You confirm or correct my initial assessment

2. We identify potential weaknesses in this solution that I might have missed

3. We consider what assumptions this code makes about:

- The environment it runs in

- The input data

- Error handling expectations

- Performance requirements

4. We discuss how maintainable this solution would be if:

- Requirements change slightly in the future

- The codebase scales significantly

- Another developer needs to modify it without context

5. You suggest improvements that would address the biggest concerns

I'm trying to develop the skill of critically evaluating solutions before implementing them. Explaining your thought process would help me learn this skill better.
