## Code to generate Employees fake data
```python
# import the libraries we need
from faker import Faker
import pandas as pd

# create an instance of Faker
fake = Faker(locale='en_US')

# Let's create a function
def create_employees(num_employees):
    # Let's create an empty list to add our employee dictionaries
    employee_list = []
    
    # Let's create an employees dictionary
    for i in range(num_employees):   # ensures we get exactly num_employees
        employee = {}
        employee['first_name'] = fake.first_name()
        employee['last_name'] = fake.last_name()
        employee['job'] = fake.job()

## Guide into generating fake Data with python Faker library (step‑by‑step)

**Goal:** Walk through creating a small Python project that generates fake employee data (CSV and optional Excel). You'll start from creating the project folder, set up a virtual environment, install the libraries, then write and run a robust script that supports both in‑memory generation (for small/medium datasets) and chunked generation (for large datasets).

---

## Project setup (file structure)

We'll use this layout:

```
faker-employees/
├─ venv/                # virtual environment (not checked into source control)
├─ outputs/             # where generated CSV/XLSX will go
├─ generate_employees.py
├─ requirements.txt
└─ README.md
```
## Setting up a Python development environment:
This ensures you have a consistent and isolated development space for your projects:
a) installing Python
Download the latest version of ```Python``` from the official website
During installation (when using Windows), ensure you check the box to "```Add Python to PATH```" so you can
run Python commands from the command line. 
If you are using windows, then also ensure you install ```WSL``` (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - this lets you run ```linux commands``` directly from windows

b) Install an IDE (e.g VS Code), 
c) Install VS Code extensions e.g (prettier formatters, autocomplete and extensions)
d) Install AI helper (e.g Copilot, Codium extension)
e) Install a virtual environment manager e.g venv
f) Install python extension on the vs code to be able to run python directly from the vs code. Then click  ▶️ to run python


## Set up a Virtual Environment: (Why virtual environments?)
They isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects and ensuring your code runs consistently.
 
### Tools for managing virtual environments:
- venv (built-in in Python 3.3+)
- virtualenv (third-party library)

## How to create and activate virtual environment
### Option I:
- Create project folder and open the folder in your terminal
- Launch virtual environment using command: ```pip install pipenv``` (if you get an error use ```sudo apt install pipenv```)
- Then activate the virtual environment using command: ```pipenv shell```
if you get error, unstall the older version of pipenv using this command:  ```sudo apt remove pipenv```

Then re- install new version using this command:
- ```pip install --user pipenv```
- Then ```sudo apt install pipenv```
Then re-activate virtual environment using command:  ```pipenv shell```


### Option II:
Create project folder and open the folder in your terminal
Launch virtual environment using command: ```python3 -m venv venv```
Then activate the virtual environment using command:
```.\venv\Scripts\activate #(for windows)```
or
```source venv/bin/activate #(for mac/ linux os)```

## Then create requirements.txt file. 
### Option I:
- Use command:   ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
- To install everything listed in the requirements.txt, 
Use command:   ```pip install -r .\requirements.txt```

## Nb:
If you run into version compatibility issues while working on your project, simply install the available version first. Then, update the version in your ```requirements.txt``` file to the one compatible with your project, and reinstall the dependencies using the updated requirements.txt

### Option II:
Install pipreqs using this command: 
```pip install pipreqs``` 
Pipreqs is a tool that automatically generates a requirements.txt file for your Python project by scanning your project folder for all the libraries your code is importing.

Then run the pipreqs tool on the current directory using this command:
```pipreqs . ```
Then install all the Python packages listed inside your requirements.txt file using this command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Install Dependencies
(Frameworks that you will use for your project e,g Faker, Pandas, Django, Rest, Flask e.t.c).
Use ```pip``` which is the recommended Python's package installer. Ensure you do this after activating your virtual environment.

## In our case, we are going to use:
- We will use `Faker` for fake data,
- `pandas` for DataFrame operations and saving,
- `openpyxl` for Excel support (if you need Excel output), and
- `tqdm` for progress bars.

We are going to install the libraries using this command:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install Faker pandas openpyxl tqdm
```

Simple **step-by-step code along instructions**  you can follow to generate fake data.

---


### Step 4: Create a Python file
- Open your project folder in vs code and create a file and name it ```generate_employees.py``` :

Or on your terminal
- ```bash
    touch generate_employees.py
  ```

---

### Step 5: Import the libraries
Inside the ```generate_employees.py``` add
```python
from faker import Faker
import pandas as pd
```

---

### Step 6: Create a Faker instance

This lets us generate fake data in English (US style). You can use other languages as you desire

```python
fake = Faker(locale='en_US')
```

---

### Step 7: Define a function to create employees

We’ll write a function that makes a list of employees, then converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
def create_employees(num_employees):
    # empty list to store employees
    employee_list = []
    
    # loop through num_employees
    for i in range(num_employees):
        employee = {}
        employee['first_name'] = fake.first_name()
        employee['last_name'] = fake.last_name()
        employee['job'] = fake.job()
        employee['department'] = fake.random_element(elements=("IT", "HR", "Marketing", "Finance"))
        employee['role'] = fake.random_element(elements=("Manager", "Developer", "Analyst", "Associate"))
        employee['salary'] = fake.random_int(min=30000, max=150000, step=1000)
        employee['email'] = fake.email()
        
        # add employee to list
        employee_list.append(employee)
    
    # convert list to pandas DataFrame
    return pd.DataFrame(employee_list)
```

---

### Step 8: Generate the data

Now we call the function to generate **5,000 fake employees**:

```python
data = create_employees(5000)
```

---

### Step 9: Save the generated data (to your desired format)

#### Save data to CSV

Export the fake data into a CSV file:

```python
data.to_csv("employees.csv", index=False)
```

---

#### Save data to Excel

Export the same data into an Excel file:

```python
data.to_excel("employees.xlsx", index=False)
```

#### Save data to json

Export the same data into a json file:

```python
research on the code to save data into json file
```

---

### Step 10: Run the script

Go back to your terminal and run:

```bash
python generate_employees.py
```

This will create **`employees.csv`** or **`employees.xlsx`** in your folder. 🎉

---

👉 Do you want me to also break it into **mini checkpoints** (like "run this much code and see the output in console before moving on") so you can test each step as you go?
