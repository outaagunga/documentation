Absolutely! Here's how you can convert this Bookstore Management System (DBA-focused) project into a viable take-home assignment for interview candidates, especially for a Database Administrator (DBA) or Backend Engineer with DBA responsibilities.

✅ Interview Take-Home Assignment: Bookstore Management System (DBA Focus)
🎯 Goal:
Design and manage a PostgreSQL database for a simple Bookstore system. Focus on schema design, user and role management, indexing, data integrity, and performance optimization.

🔧 Tasks & Questions
📌 Part 1: Schema Design
Task 1: Create a PostgreSQL database named bookstore_db.

Task 2: Create the following tables with appropriate data types and constraints:

Table: books

id: auto-incrementing primary key
title: required string (max 200 characters)
author: required string (max 100 characters)
published_year: integer
available: boolean (default: true)
Table: members

id: auto-incrementing primary key
full_name: required string (max 150 characters)
email: required, unique string (max 100 characters)
join_date: date (default: current date)
Table: borrow_records

id: auto-incrementing primary key
member_id: foreign key referencing members(id)
book_id: foreign key referencing books(id)
borrow_date: date (default: current date)
return_date: date (nullable)
Question: Why is it important to enforce foreign key constraints in this schema?

📌 Part 2: Sample Data
Task 3: Insert at least 3 books and 2 members into the respective tables.

Task 4: Insert at least 1 borrow record showing a member borrowing a book.

Bonus: Try inserting a borrow record for a non-existent member — what happens? Why?

📌 Part 3: Indexing for Performance
Task 5: Create indexes to improve lookup performance for the following use cases:

Searching books by title
Searching members by email
Deliverables:

SQL statements for creating indexes
Brief explanation: Why were these fields chosen for indexing?
Bonus: What are the trade-offs of adding too many indexes?
📌 Part 4: User Roles & Permissions
Task 6: Create two roles:

librarian — full access
assistant — can only read and insert into books and members, but not delete or update anything.
Task 7: Assign appropriate privileges to these roles.

Bonus: Create a user account for each role and test their access.

📌 Part 5: Data Integrity
Task 8: Prevent duplicate borrow records for the same book on the same day by the same member.

Implement a constraint to enforce this rule.
📌 Part 6: Backup & Monitoring (Conceptual)
Task 9 (Explain Only):

How would you back up this database from the command line?
How would you restore it?
Task 10 (Explain Only):

How would you monitor active connections to the database?
🧠 Bonus Questions (Optional but Valuable)
What happens if you update or delete a member that has borrow records? How would you handle that?
How would you schedule regular backups using PostgreSQL tools or cron jobs?
If this Bookstore grew to millions of records, how would you optimize performance further?
🗂️ Deliverables
SQL file(s) or .sql scripts for:

Schema creation
Sample data insertion
Index creation
Role and permission management
Constraints

Any challenges or assumptions
🧪 Evaluation Criteria
Area	What We Look For
Correctness	Schema, constraints, and permissions work properly
Clarity	Code is clean and readable
Security	Roles and privileges are set up logically
Performance Awareness	Smart use of indexes and constraints
Documentation	Clear explanations of your choices
Bonus Effort	Thoughtful answers to advanced questions
Would you like a ready-to-use template with folder structure and placeholders for these deliverables?
