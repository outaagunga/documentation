## 🧭 PART 1 — Define the Mission

### 1. Pick a Strong Investigative Topic

Your story must **reveal something hidden**, **expose wrongdoing**, or **highlight systemic problems**.
Use AI to brainstorm angles.

**Prompt Example:**

> “List 10 underreported investigative story ideas in Kenya related to corruption, environment, or digital privacy.”

💡 **Tip:** Filter for public interest, potential impact, and available data sources.  
My chosen topic is _____________________  

---

### 2. Frame the Core Question

Every investigation starts with a guiding question:

> “What’s really happening behind X?”
> “Who benefits from Y?”
> “Why does Z persist despite government funding?”

**Ask AI:**

> “Help me refine this question for an investigative story so it’s specific, evidence-driven, and engaging.”

My guiding question is _____________________  

---

### 3. Set Clear Objectives

* **What do you want to prove or reveal?**
* **Who is affected and why should readers care?**
* **What change or awareness should this story inspire?**

**AI prompt:**

> “Help me outline objectives and key questions for my story on illegal sand mining in Machakos.”

My chosen objectives are  _____________________

## 🔍 PART 2 — Research Like a Pro (with AI as Your Assistant)

### 4. Build a Research Map

Organize your information sources:

* Government and audit reports
* Public datasets (Open Data portals, World Bank, county budgets) 
* Eyewitness accounts or whistleblowers
* Expert opinion 
* On-site verification

**AI prompt:**

> “Create a research plan with 3 credible sources per category for a story on school funding misuse in Kenya.”

My credible sources are  _____________________  

---
### Getting Intelligence  
Use AI to collect background context and identify credible leads before fieldwork  

Fact Gathering Prompt:  
> What are the key organizations, policies, and public reports linked to [e.g illegal logging in Mau Forest]

Source Identification Prompt:  
> List Kenyan government officials, NGOs, and local activists working on [e.g forest conservation in Narok County]  

Market / Systemic Analysis Prompt:  
> What are the main economic and policy factors driving [e.g deforestation in Kenya over the past 5 years] 


### 5. Gather Evidence

Use AI for:

* **Summarizing long documents**
* **Detect data patterns (budgets, procurement, etc.)
* **Translate reports**
* **Drafting interview questions**

**Prompt Example:**

> “Summarize this 60-page audit report into key red flags of corruption. Highlight any inconsistencies.”

⚠️ **Caution:** Always verify — AI can hallucinate. Cross-check every claim with official data or credible media.
Use AI to structure interviews that uncover both personal experiences and systemic accountability:  
> Draft 8 investigative questions for a local chief about irregular land allocation in Turkana
> Write 5 tough accountability questions for a ministry official about stalled water projects  

My gathered evidences are  _____________________  

---

### 6. Verify and Cross-check

* Use **web search** and **fact-checking tools** (Africa Check, PesaCheck, Google Fact Check Explorer).
* Ask AI to compare multiple sources:

  > “Compare how Nation.Africa and Standard Digital reported on the Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (KEMSA) scandal. Highlight discrepancies and unexplored angles.”

My comparison is _____________________

## 🧩 PART 3 — Structure the Investigation

### 7. Outline the Story Flow

A compelling structure often follows this pattern:

1. Hook / Lead: A striking scene or revelation.
2. Problem: Define the issue and its public importance.
3. Evidence: Present documents, data, and testimonies.
4. Impact: Show who gains or suffers.
5. Response: Present official reactions or denials.
6. Call-to-Action: End with what should happen next.  

**AI prompt:**

> Using the structure Hook → Context → Investigation → Evidence → Human Impact → Accountability → Call to Action, create a 1,500-word outline with suggested visuals  

My outline is _____________________  
---

### 8. Build the Narrative Voice

Stay factual but vivid. Mix storytelling with verification:  
- Short, direct sentences
- Real quotes and human scenes
- Verified statistics  

**Ask AI:**

> “Rewrite this section in an investigative yet human-centered tone similar to BBC Africa Eye.”

---

## ✍️ PART 4 — Writing the Draft

### 9. Draft with AI Collaboration

You can co-write efficiently by alternating:

* You: provide facts, quotes, and findings
* AI: structure, tighten, and suggest flow improvements

**Example Workflow:**

> “Here’s my paragraph on toxic waste dumping in Nairobi River. Suggest a rewrite that increases tension and clarity but keeps the facts intact.”

💡 **Tip:** Use ChatGPT to test readability:

My story draft is _____________________  

> “Check this paragraph’s Flesch-Kincaid grade level and make it below 8.0.”

---

### 10. Follow Ethical and Legal Standards 

* Never fabricate quotes or data.
* Protect anonymous or vulnerable sources.
* Let evidence lead your conclusions.
* Cite every source clearly.  

Ask AI:
> “Generate a source citation list for these materials using AP or APA style.”

---

## 🧮 PART 5 — Data Visualization & Supporting Media

### 11. Use AI Tools to Enhance Visuals

* **Datawrapper, Flourish, or Tableau Public** → for charts
* **AI image tools (DALL·E or Canva)** → to create illustrations or safe visualizations (avoid deepfakes)

Prompt:

> “Suggest 3 visual ideas to support a story about water scarcity in Turkana.”

---

## 🧠 PART 6 — Polishing & Publishing

### 12. Edit for Impact

* Cut jargon and repetition
* Use subheadings, bold stats, and pull quotes
* Keep sentences short (15–20 words max)

AI prompt:

> “Edit this 800-word piece for clarity, AP Style, and a grade level below 8.0.”

---

### 13. Write a Strong Conclusion with a Call-to-Action

Example CTA:

> “Have you witnessed similar issues in your county? Share your experience or tip in the comments — your insight could fuel the next investigation.”

Ask AI:

> “Suggest three call-to-action endings for a story on fake fertilizer distribution in Kenya.”

---

### 14. Publish and Promote

* Post on **Medium, Substack, or your own blog**
* Share snippets on **Twitter/X, LinkedIn, or TikTok**
* Use AI for promotion ideas:

  > “Write 5 social media posts that drive engagement for this investigation.”
