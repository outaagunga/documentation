🧮 **4️⃣ Simple Risk Example**

**Scenario:**
Account = $500 Risk = 1 % Stop Loss = 25 pips Pair = EUR/USD

**Step 1:** Amount to risk = $500 × 0.01 = $5
**Step 2:** Value per pip = $5 ÷ 25 = $0.20 / pip
**Step 3:** In MT5, choose lot size ≈ 0.02 lots (micro)

💡 *Use this formula anytime:*

> Lot Size ≈ ( Account × Risk% ) ÷ ( Stop Loss pips × Pip Value per Lot )

# 🕘 **Daily Forex + AI Trading Routine Checklist**

> 🎯 Goal: Trade with clarity, reduce emotion, and use AI for analysis, discipline, and reflection.

---

## 🌅 **PHASE 1: Morning Preparation (Before Market Activity)**

### Step 1️⃣ — Review the Economic Calendar Volatility Check  

**Action:**

* Check for high-impact news (e.g., interest rate decisions, CPI, NFP).
* Identify which currencies will be volatile today.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “List today’s high-impact Forex news events and explain how they might affect EUR/USD and GBP/USD.”  

Or  
> “List today’s Tier 1 economic events and explain the immediate directional bias those events are expected to cause on EUR/USD and USD/JPY.”  

✅ *AI Output should tell you which sessions or times to be cautious (e.g., avoid trading 30 minutes before/after NFP).*

---

### Step 2️⃣ — Analyze the Market Overview

**Action:**

* Open **TradingView** or your broker’s charting tool.
* Review higher timeframes (Daily → 4H → 1H) to find market direction.
* Identify major Supply and Demand zones and the last swing point.  

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “Based on current price trends for EUR/USD and GBP/JPY, summarize the overall market bias (bullish, bearish, or ranging).”   

Or  
> Based on current price action on the 4H chart for GBP/USD, is the structure currently exhibiting higher highs/higher lows or lower highs/lower lows? State the current key support and resistance levels  

✅ *AI Output helps you focus only on pairs with clear direction.*

---

### Step 3️⃣ — Identify Key Zones & Opportunities

**Action:**

* Compare your manual structure analysis (Step 2) with the economic outlook (Step 1).
* Identify 1-2 scenarios that align with your strategy (e.g., a pullback to a key level in an overall uptrend).
* Mark **support**, **resistance**, and **trendlines** on your charts.
* Note zones where price has reacted multiple times.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> I'm looking for a long trade on AUD/USD because it's at major support (0.6550) and the 4H trend is up. Challenge this bias by listing the top three bearish factors based on recent market data or sentiment.”

Or  
> “Here’s what I see: EUR/USD is near 1.0800 support and trending up. Does that suggest a buy zone or possible reversal area?”

✅ *AI confirms or challenges your chart reading.*

---

## ☀️ **PHASE 2: Midday — Trade Planning and Execution**

### Step 4️⃣ — Formulate Your Trade Plan

**Action:**

* Pinpoint the exact Entry, Stop Loss (SL), and Take Profit (TP) based on your strategy's criteria (e.g., candlestick confirmation, indicator cross).
* Define the reason why the trade should work and the condition that proves it was wrong (SL).
* Identify 1–2 best trade setups that match your rules.
* Confirm entries, stop loss, and take profit zones.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “Review my plan: Buy EUR/USD above 1.0830, Stop Loss 1.0800, Take Profit 1.0900. Risk = 1%. Does this plan align with a bullish continuation setup?”  

Or  
> “My strategy is: Buy EUR/USD at 1.0830, SL at 1.0800 (30 pips), TP at 1.0900 (70 pips). Calculate the Risk-Reward Ratio (R:R) and verify that this setup aligns with a valid chart pattern (e.g., continuation pattern).”

✅ *AI checks your plan logic and reminds you of potential risk issues.*

---

### Step 5️⃣ — Calculate Position Size

**Action:**

* Use an AI-powered risk calculator or online lot size tool.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “My account equity is $5,000. I risk 1.5% per trade. My Stop Loss is 25 pips on USD/CAD. Calculate the exact lot size I need to open.”  

Or  
> “I have a $100 account, risk 2% per trade, stop loss 30 pips on EUR/USD. What’s my lot size?”

✅ *AI helps maintain discipline and consistency in your risk management.*

---

### Step 6️⃣ — Execute the Trade (on MT5)

**Action:**

* Log in to **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.
* Enter trade details exactly as per your plan.
* Place Stop Loss and Take Profit immediately.
* Take a screenshot or note your reasoning.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “Trade executed: Buy USD/CAD at 1.3750. Rationale: Break of minor resistance following a central bank announcement. What are the next two psychological price barriers this trade must overcome to reach the TP?”  

Or  
>“I just placed a buy on EUR/USD at 1.0835. Summarize my rationale and list what conditions would invalidate this setup.”

✅ *AI helps you build trading accountability and emotional control.*

---

## 🌇 **PHASE 3: Afternoon — Trade Management & Emotion Check**

### Step 7️⃣ — Monitor Trades Objectively

**Action:**

* Avoid watching every candle. Review your trade hourly.
* Use the AI to evaluate protective actions like trailing the stop loss or taking partial profits.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “My trade is currently +25 pips in profit but hasn’t hit target. What’s a logical way to trail my stop loss?”  

✅ *AI provides unemotional, rule-based decision advice.*

---

### Step 8️⃣ — Emotion Control Check

**Action:**

* Pause and reflect on your emotional state (greed, fear, revenge trading).

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “I feel anxious because my last two trades lost. What should I remind myself before placing another trade?”  

✅ *AI gives psychological reinforcement to maintain discipline.*

---

## 🌙 **PHASE 4: Evening — Review and Improve**

### Step 9️⃣ — Trade Journal Update

**Action:**

* Record every trade: pair, direction, reason, result, emotion, and screenshot.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “Summarize my trade log for today and highlight what I did right or wrong.”
> “Which trade today best followed my rules?”

✅ *AI extracts insights, helping you refine your habits.*

---

### Step 🔟 — Daily Performance Summary

**Action:**

* Review P/L (profit/loss) and learning notes.
* Don’t focus only on money — check if you *followed your plan.*

**AI Prompt Example:**

> “Analyze today’s trading performance. Rate my discipline level from 1–10 and suggest one improvement for tomorrow.”

✅ *AI gives performance coaching feedback — your “trading therapist.”*

---

## 🔁 **PHASE 5: Weekly Review (Every Friday or Sunday)**

**Action:**

* Review the week’s trades together with AI.

**AI Prompt Examples:**

> “Analyze my last 20 trades — what’s my win rate, and which pairs perform best?”

✅ *AI detects hidden patterns and helps refine your strategy.*

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Analysis, AI Collaboration & Testing

### Step 5️⃣ — Develop and Document Your Trading Strategy

Define your personal rules so AI can assist you consistently.

**Example:**

```
My Strategy: Moving Average Trend Strategy  
- Entry: Buy when 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA  
- Exit: Close when RSI > 70  
- Stop Loss: 30 pips below entry  
- Take Profit: 60 pips above entry  
- Risk: 2% of account per trade
```

🧠 *Ask your AI:*

---

### Step 6️⃣ — Analyze the Market Using TradingView + AI

**Follow-Along Snippet:**

2. Scroll backward in time and apply your rules as if you were trading live.  
3. Note each “buy” or “sell” signal on paper or Excel.  
4. Ask your AI assistant to summarize:  
   “Based on my backtest data, what is my win rate, risk-to-reward ratio, and what can I improve?”  
```

AI will point out weaknesses (e.g., “Your losses cluster around major news events — avoid trading during high volatility”).

---

### Step 8️⃣ — Demo Trade with AI Feedback

**Follow-Along Snippet:**

```
1. Log into your MT5 demo account.  
2. Place a trade based on your AI-reviewed setup.  
3. Record trade details in your journal (entry, exit, profit/loss).  
4. Ask your AI: “Review my last 5 trades. What common mistake do you see?”  
```

AI can summarize patterns — e.g., “You entered too early before confirmation” or “You’re risking too much relative to stop loss.”

---

## 💼 Phase 3: Live Execution & Ongoing AI Partnership

### Step 9️⃣ — Go Live (Cautiously)

**Follow-Along Snippet:**

```
1. Deposit a small amount (e.g., KSh 1,000–5,000).  
2. Keep risk per trade under 1–2%.  
3. Trade only setups you and AI have both confirmed.  
4. Review every trade using AI feedback prompts like:
