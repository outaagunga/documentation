# üïò **Daily Forex + AI Trading Routine Checklist**

> üéØ Goal: Trade with clarity, reduce emotion, and use AI for analysis, discipline, and reflection.

---

## üåÖ **PHASE 1: Morning Preparation (Before Market Activity)**

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Review the Economic Calendar Volatility Check  

**Action:**

* Check for high-impact news (e.g., interest rate decisions, CPI, NFP).
* Identify which currencies will be volatile today.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúList today‚Äôs high-impact Forex news events and explain how they might affect EUR/USD and GBP/USD.‚Äù  

Or  
> ‚ÄúList today‚Äôs Tier 1 economic events and explain the immediate directional bias those events are expected to cause on EUR/USD and USD/JPY.‚Äù  

‚úÖ *AI Output should tell you which sessions or times to be cautious (e.g., avoid trading 30 minutes before/after NFP).*

---

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Analyze the Market Overview

**Action:**

* Open **TradingView** or your broker‚Äôs charting tool.
* Review higher timeframes (Daily ‚Üí 4H ‚Üí 1H) to find market direction.
* Identify major Supply and Demand zones and the last swing point.  

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúBased on current price trends for EUR/USD and GBP/JPY, summarize the overall market bias (bullish, bearish, or ranging).‚Äù   

Or  
> Based on current price action on the 4H chart for GBP/USD, is the structure currently exhibiting higher highs/higher lows or lower highs/lower lows? State the current key support and resistance levels  

‚úÖ *AI Output helps you focus only on pairs with clear direction.*

---

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Identify Key Zones & Opportunities

**Action:**

* Compare your manual structure analysis (Step 2) with the economic outlook (Step 1).
* Identify 1-2 scenarios that align with your strategy (e.g., a pullback to a key level in an overall uptrend).
* Mark **support**, **resistance**, and **trendlines** on your charts.
* Note zones where price has reacted multiple times.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> I'm looking for a long trade on AUD/USD because it's at major support (0.6550) and the 4H trend is up. Challenge this bias by listing the top three bearish factors based on recent market data or sentiment.‚Äù

Or  
> ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I see: EUR/USD is near 1.0800 support and trending up. Does that suggest a buy zone or possible reversal area?‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI confirms or challenges your chart reading.*

---

## ‚òÄÔ∏è **PHASE 2: Midday ‚Äî Trade Planning and Execution**

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Formulate Your Trade Plan

**Action:**

* Pinpoint the exact Entry, Stop Loss (SL), and Take Profit (TP) based on your strategy's criteria (e.g., candlestick confirmation, indicator cross).
* Define the reason why the trade should work and the condition that proves it was wrong (SL).
* Identify 1‚Äì2 best trade setups that match your rules.
* Confirm entries, stop loss, and take profit zones.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúReview my plan: Buy EUR/USD above 1.0830, Stop Loss 1.0800, Take Profit 1.0900. Risk = 1%. Does this plan align with a bullish continuation setup?‚Äù  

Or  
> ‚ÄúMy strategy is: Buy EUR/USD at 1.0830, SL at 1.0800 (30 pips), TP at 1.0900 (70 pips). Calculate the Risk-Reward Ratio (R:R) and verify that this setup aligns with a valid chart pattern (e.g., continuation pattern).‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI checks your plan logic and reminds you of potential risk issues.*

---

### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Calculate Position Size

**Action:**

* Use an AI-powered risk calculator or online lot size tool.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúMy account equity is $5,000. I risk 1.5% per trade. My Stop Loss is 25 pips on USD/CAD. Calculate the exact lot size I need to open.‚Äù  

Or  
> ‚ÄúI have a $100 account, risk 2% per trade, stop loss 30 pips on EUR/USD. What‚Äôs my lot size?‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI helps maintain discipline and consistency in your risk management.*

---

### Step 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Execute the Trade (on MT5)

**Action:**

* Log in to **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)**.
* Enter trade details exactly as per your plan.
* Place Stop Loss and Take Profit immediately.
* Take a screenshot or note your reasoning.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúTrade executed: Buy USD/CAD at 1.3750. Rationale: Break of minor resistance following a central bank announcement. What are the next two psychological price barriers this trade must overcome to reach the TP?‚Äù  

Or  
>‚ÄúI just placed a buy on EUR/USD at 1.0835. Summarize my rationale and list what conditions would invalidate this setup.‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI helps you build trading accountability and emotional control.*

---

## üåá **PHASE 3: Afternoon ‚Äî Trade Management & Emotion Check**

### Step 7Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Monitor Trades Objectively

**Action:**

* Avoid watching every candle. Review your trade hourly.
* Use the AI to evaluate protective actions like trailing the stop loss or taking partial profits.

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúMy trade is currently +25 pips in profit but hasn‚Äôt hit target. What‚Äôs a logical way to trail my stop loss?‚Äù  

‚úÖ *AI provides unemotional, rule-based decision advice.*

---

### Step 8Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Emotion Control Check

**Action:**

* Pause and reflect on your emotional state (greed, fear, revenge trading).

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúI feel anxious because my last two trades lost. What should I remind myself before placing another trade?‚Äù  

‚úÖ *AI gives psychological reinforcement to maintain discipline.*

---

## üåô **PHASE 4: Evening ‚Äî Review and Improve**

### Step 9Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Trade Journal Update

**Action:**

> ‚ÄúWhich trade today best followed my rules?‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI extracts insights, helping you refine your habits.*

---

### Step üîü ‚Äî Daily Performance Summary

**Action:**

* Review P/L (profit/loss) and learning notes.
* Don‚Äôt focus only on money ‚Äî check if you *followed your plan.*

**AI Prompt Example:**

> ‚ÄúAnalyze today‚Äôs trading performance. Rate my discipline level from 1‚Äì10 and suggest one improvement for tomorrow.‚Äù

‚úÖ *AI gives performance coaching feedback ‚Äî your ‚Äútrading therapist.‚Äù*

---

## üîÅ **PHASE 5: Weekly Review (Every Friday or Sunday)**

**Action:**

* Review the week‚Äôs trades together with AI.

**AI Prompt Examples:**

| Tool                                        | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Candle chart**                            | Visual clarity for closures                       |
| **Support & Resistance zones**              | Identify structure                                |
| **Trendlines or structure mapping**         | Directional bias                                  |
| **Supply/Demand zones**                     | Identify potential reversal or continuation zones |
| **Volume or momentum indicator (optional)** | Confirms strength behind closures                 |

> Keep charts clean. Closures alone with clear levels can outperform cluttered setups.

---

## üß© 3. Step-by-Step Trading Process

### **Step 1: Identify Market Bias**

Use the **higher timeframe** (4H or Daily):

* Higher highs & higher lows ‚Üí Bullish bias
* Lower highs & lower lows ‚Üí Bearish bias

> Only take trades *in the direction* of this bias until proven otherwise.

---

### **Step 2: Mark Key Swing Levels**

Identify:

* Recent **swing highs** (resistance)
* Recent **swing lows** (support)

Mark them clearly on your chart.
These are your **decision zones** ‚Äî where closures will confirm your next move.

---

### **Step 3: Wait for a Candle Closure**

Move to your execution timeframe (e.g., 1H).
Watch how price reacts near your swing levels:

* **Bullish closure above resistance ‚Üí** Buy confirmation.
* **Bearish closure below support ‚Üí** Sell confirmation.
* **Rejection wick with no closure ‚Üí** Stay out.

‚úÖ A ‚Äúvalid closure‚Äù means:

* Candle body closes *beyond* the level (not just wick).
* Candle has a solid body (not a tiny doji).
* Ideally supported by momentum (strong close).

---

### **Step 4: Entry After Confirmation**

Once closure occurs:

* Wait for a **retest or pullback** to the broken level.

  * Example: price closes above resistance ‚Üí retests it as new support ‚Üí enter buy.
* Enter on lower timeframe confirmation (e.g., bullish engulfing on 15min).

**Entry Rule Example:**

> After closure, enter trade on retest of the level with confirmation candle in direction of the close.

---

### **Step 5: Stop Loss Placement**

Place your **stop loss**:

* A few pips below/above the **rejection zone or last swing** opposite your trade.
* Ensure you‚Äôre not too tight ‚Äî give market breathing space.

Example:

* Buy ‚Üí Stop below last swing low.
* Sell ‚Üí Stop above last swing high.

---

### **Step 6: Profit Targets**

Two main approaches:

| Style            | Target Rule              | Notes                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Conservative** | 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio | Safer and consistent        |
| **Structural**   | Next key level or zone   | Fits higher timeframe moves |

Optional: Take partial profit at 1:1 and move stop to breakeven.

---

### **Step 7: Trade Management**

* **If a new opposite closure forms**, exit early (market sentiment changed).
* Trail stops behind swing structure if trend continues.
* Never add to a losing position.

---

## üìä 4. Example Setup

**Scenario:** EUR/USD on 1H chart

1. 4H trend: Bullish
2. Price hits resistance at 1.0800
3. After consolidation, candle *closes above* 1.0800 ‚Üí **closure confirmation**
4. Wait for pullback to 1.0800 ‚Üí bullish 15min candle forms ‚Üí **enter buy**
5. Stop: below 1.0780
6. Target: 1.0850 (R:R ‚âà 1:2.5)
7. Manage trade ‚Äî if hourly candle closes bearish below 1.0800, exit early.

This trade aligns with structure, uses closure for confirmation, and controls risk.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 5. Timeframe Rules

| Purpose            | Recommended Timeframe |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Trend analysis     | 4H / Daily            |
| Setup confirmation | 1H                    |
| Entry refinement   | 15min / 30min         |

**Rule of thumb:**
Validate closures on the **same timeframe** where the setup is identified.

---

## üí∞ 6. Risk Management

* Risk **1‚Äì2% per trade** max.
* Maintain at least **1:2 R:R**.
* Never trade without a stop loss.
* Avoid overlapping trades in correlated pairs (e.g., EUR/USD + GBP/USD).

---

## üß† 7. Example Trading Journal Entry

| Field     | Example                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Pair      | GBP/USD                                            |
| Timeframe | 1H                                                 |
| Setup     | Bullish closure above 1.2600                       |
| Entry     | 1.2605 (retest entry)                              |
| Stop      | 1.2570                                             |
| Target    | 1.2665                                             |
| R:R       | 1:2                                                |
| Outcome   | Win (hit target)                                   |
| Notes     | Strong 1H close, confirmed on 15min, trend aligned |

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Key Advantages

* Filters out emotional trades.
* Improves accuracy of breakout/reversal setups.
* Works across pairs and timeframes.
* Easy to integrate into structure-based trading systems.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 9. Limitations

* Fewer trades ‚Üí requires patience.
* Late entries in volatile moves.
* Needs confluence (structure + liquidity + closure).

> **Solution:** Focus on quality over quantity. Closures give you *fewer but higher probability* setups.

---

## üß© 10. Combine With Other Concepts

For maximum edge:

* **Supply & Demand Zones** ‚Üí for entry precision.
* **Liquidity Sweeps** ‚Üí spot fakeouts before real closures.
* **Market Structure Shifts** ‚Üí align with trend transitions.
* **Volume or RSI** ‚Üí confirm strength of closure.

---

## üöÄ Final Takeaway

> ‚ÄúThe closure is not your entry ‚Äî it‚Äôs your confirmation.‚Äù
> Profitable traders **wait for proof**, not promises.
> This plan helps you act after the market *proves* its direction.

Would you like me to turn this plan into a **visual trading checklist** or **PDF workbook** (so you can print or use while trading)?
It would include sample charts, step summaries, and space for notes/journals.

## üß† ‚ÄúPrevious Two-Day Low‚Äù Reversal Trading Plan

### üéØ Goal

Trade market reversals on Crash/Boom indices using daily structure levels and 15-minute confirmation patterns for high-probability, low-stress setups.

---

### ü™ú Step 1: Determine Overall Market Bias (Weekly Timeframe)

**Objective:** Identify the dominant trend and potential reversal zones.

**Checklist:**

* Switch to **Weekly timeframe (W1)**.
* Observe if price is in a **bullish trend**, **bearish trend**, or **range**.
* Identify any **flag, channel, or wedge pattern** forming.
* Draw **two trendlines** (one on resistance, one on support) to define the channel.
* Mark potential **reversal zones** where price might react next.

**Rule:** Trade only in the direction of potential reversals near major support/resistance.

---

### ü™ú Step 2: Mark Key Levels (Daily Timeframe)

**Objective:** Locate the ‚ÄúPrevious Two-Day Low‚Äù ‚Äî the foundation of this strategy.

**Checklist:**

* Switch to **Daily timeframe (D1)**.
* Identify and mark the **lows of the previous two candles**.
* Draw a **horizontal line** at the lowest of those two points.
* Note that this level acts as a **potential support or resistance** zone.

**Logic:**

> These previous lows often mark where institutional buyers or sellers were active ‚Äî meaning price may react again when revisiting the zone.

---

### ü™ú Step 3: Drop to Lower Timeframe for Confirmation (15-Minute Chart)

**Objective:** Wait for price action confirmation before entering any trade.

**Checklist:**

* Switch to **15-Minute (M15)** timeframe once price reaches your daily level.
* Look for **reversal patterns**, such as:

  * ‚úÖ Pin Bar (rejection wick)
  * ‚úÖ Bullish/Bearish Engulfing
  * ‚úÖ Double Top/Bottom
  * ‚úÖ Head-and-Shoulders or Inverted H&S
* Confirm that **momentum slows** and **price rejects** the zone.

**Rule:**
Do **not** enter immediately when price touches the level ‚Äî always wait for a clear reversal signal.

---

### ü™ú Step 4: Execute the Trade

**Objective:** Enter with discipline, manage risk, and lock in profits.

**Execution Steps:**

* **Entry:** Place a buy/sell order after confirmation candle closes.
* **Stop Loss (SL):**

  * For Buys ‚Üí below the rejection wick.
  * For Sells ‚Üí above the rejection wick.
* **Take Profit (TP):**

  * At the next **key swing high/low** or **1:2 risk-reward** level.
* **Risk:** Limit each trade to **1‚Äì2% of account balance.**
* **Optional:** Move SL to breakeven once price moves 1:1 in your favor.

**Pairs/Markets:**
Crash 1000, Boom 1000, Crash 500, Boom 500, and Crash/Boom 300.

---

### ü™ú Step 5: Review, Journal, and Improve

**Objective:** Build confidence and consistency through reflection.

**After Each Trade:**

* Record the trade details:

  * Pair/Asset traded
  * Entry and exit price
  * Reason for entry (pattern, structure)
  * Result (+/‚Äì pips or %)
* Take screenshots of the setup.
* Note what worked and what didn‚Äôt.

**Weekly Routine:**

* Review all trades for patterns or repeated mistakes.
* Refine entry confirmations and timing.

---

### üí° Pro Tips

* Trade **quality, not quantity** ‚Äî two clean trades per week are enough.
* Avoid high-volatility periods (major news events).
* Stick to the **same assets** to understand their behavior.
* Always follow your **plan, not your emotions.**

# Trading Plan ‚Äî Step by Step (Daily-candle entry method)

Below is a compact, practical trading plan you can follow every day. It converts the classroom transcript into a repeatable process: **mark the daily candle close ‚Üí use lower-timeframe structure (imbalances / break & retest) ‚Üí enter, size, and manage the trade**.

---

## 1) Daily routine (what you do once per day)

1. At daily candle close (your platform/timezone) **mark the previous daily candle‚Äôs close** (draw a horizontal line at the close price).
2. Note whether that daily candle was **bullish** or **bearish**.

   * **Bullish daily candle** ‚Üí expect moves **above** the close to be sell zones and **below** the close to be buy zones (per the instructor‚Äôs rule: bullish candle forms low ‚Üí high).
   * **Bearish daily candle** ‚Üí expect moves **above** the close to be sell zones and **below** the close to be buy zones (bearish opens, creates high, then low).
     *(Short version: mark the daily close ‚Äî then look for lower-TF confirmation above/below that level depending on candle direction.)*
3. Switch to a lower timeframe (5-min or 15-min). Look for **structure** around the daily-close line:

   * Break of Structure (BOS) + retest
   * Imbalance (unfilled wick / gap of candles) ‚Äî open of imbalance is a high-probability entry area
   * A clear 1-2-3 reversal pattern or higher-timeframe aligned retest

---

## 2) Entry rules (exact conditions to take a trade)

Follow **all** of these before taking a trade:

1. **Daily filter** ‚Äî Marked daily candle close. Identify direction (bull / bear).
2. **Trade direction rule**:

   * If daily candle closed **bullish** ‚Üí look to **buy** on **retrace below** that daily close (price must form a buy structure below the close).
   * If daily candle closed **bearish** ‚Üí look to **sell** on **move above** that daily close (price must form a sell structure above the close).
3. **Lower-TF confirmation (required)** ‚Äî one of:

   * BOS on lower TF followed by a retest and rejection (wick + bearish/bullish rejection candle).
   * Open-of-imbalance entry (price returns to the imbalance/open then shows rejection).
   * 1-2-3 reversal with clear S/R and structure alignment.
4. **Entry candle confirmation** ‚Äî enter on the first clean candle showing directional conviction (e.g., engulfing, bullish/bearish close with momentum) after the retest/rejection.
5. **No entry if**: structure contradicts the daily filter, or price is inside a congested zone without a clear imbalance or retest.

---

## 3) Stop loss and take profit rules

1. **Stop Loss (SL)**: place SL logically ‚Äî one of:

   * Above/below the swing high/low used for the BOS/retest.
   * Above/below the imbalance zone that you used for entry (a few pips beyond the zone).
   * **Never** set SL arbitrarily ‚Äî it must match structure.
2. **Targets / Take Profit (TP)**:

   * **TP1 = 1R** (risk amount) ‚Äî take partial profits (for example 50%) at 1R.
   * **TP2 = 2R or 3R** ‚Äî trail the rest, or use a running ATR-based trailing stop.
   * Alternatively, use the next logical S/R on a higher TF as TP.
3. **Minimum accepted R:R**: aim for at least **1:1** and prefer **1:2+** setups. If the setup only gives <1:1, skip.

---

## 4) Position sizing (exact formula + worked example)

**Position size formula (USD example):**

1. `Account Risk $ = Account Balance √ó Risk%`
2. `Dollar risk per unit = StopLoss (pips) √ó PipValue (per 1.00 lots)`
3. `Lots to trade = Account Risk $ √∑ Dollar risk per unit`

**Worked example ‚Äî compute step by step (digit-by-digit arithmetic shown):**

* Account balance = **$1,000**.
* Risk per trade = **1%** ‚Üí `Account Risk $ = 1000 √ó 0.01 = 10`.

  * (1000 √ó 0.01: 1000 √ó 0.01 = 10)
* Stop Loss = **25 pips**.
* Assume pip value for **0.01 lot** (micro-lot) = **$0.10** (common for USD-quoted pairs). Then:

  * Dollar risk per **0.01 lot** = `25 pips √ó $0.10 = $2.50`.

    * (25 √ó 0.10 = 2.50)
  * How many 0.01 lots? `Account Risk $ √∑ Dollar risk per 0.01 lot = 10 √∑ 2.5 = 4`.

    * (10 √∑ 2.5 = 4)
  * So 4 √ó 0.01 lot = **0.04 standard lots**.
* **Result:** trade **0.04 lots** to risk $10 with a 25-pip SL.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes: pip value depends on instrument and broker. Use your broker‚Äôs lot‚Üípip calculator or spreadsheet to compute exact sizing for that instrument. The formula above is universal.

---

## 5) Trade management rules (after entry)

1. Take **partial profit at TP1 (1R)** ‚Äî e.g., close 50% of position. Move SL to breakeven + 1‚Äì2 pips.
2. Let the remainder run to TP2 (2R/3R) or trail with ATR (e.g., trail when price moves 1R by using 0.5√óATR as stop).
3. If price hits breakeven after partial take, consider moving SL to a level that secures a small profit for the remaining size (e.g., +0.5R).
4. If price action invalidates the trade structure (unexpected BOS against you), exit immediately even before SL.

---

## 6) Risk & money management rules (daily/monthly limits)

1. **Max risk per trade:** 1% of account (adjust to 0.5% for conservative approach).
2. **Max daily drawdown stop:** 3% of account (if reached, stop trading for the day).
3. **Max open trades:** 2‚Äì3 (avoid overleveraging).
4. **Max correlated exposure:** If trades are correlated (same pair direction), reduce combined risk.

---

## 7) Examples (concise)

### Bullish daily candle example (buy setup)

1. Daily candle closed **bullish** ‚Äî mark close at 1.2500.
2. On 5-min, price retraces **below** 1.2500 and forms BOS on 15-min, then retests and shows bullish rejection.
3. Entry: buy at 1.2470 (retest rejection). SL: 1.2430 (40 pips below entry). TP1: 1.2510 (40 pips ‚Üí 1R). TP2: 1.2590 (2R).
4. Size per position sizing rules.

### Bearish daily candle example (sell setup)

1. Daily candle closed **bearish** ‚Äî mark close at 1.3500.
2. On 5-min, price rallies **above** 1.3500 then forms a market structure top and fails a retest.
3. Entry: sell at 1.3520. SL: 1.3560 (40 pips). TP1: 1.3480 (40 pips ‚Üí 1R). TP2: 1.3400 (2R).

---

## 8) Pre-market checklist (quick before taking any trade)

* [ ] Daily candle close marked.
* [ ] Direction: bullish / bearish (daily).
* [ ] Lower-TF structure aligned (BOS + retest, imbalance, or 1-2-3).
* [ ] Entry candle shows rejection/conviction.
* [ ] SL placed logically (swing/imbalance).
* [ ] Position size computed per risk rules.
* [ ] TP1 and TP2 defined.
* [ ] Journal fields ready (see template below).

---

## 9) Trade journal template (fields to record each trade)

* Date / Time
* Instrument / Pair
* Daily candle direction (Bull/Bear)
* Daily close price (level)
* Lower TF used (5m / 15m)
* Entry price
* Stop loss price & pips
* Position size (lots)
* Risk $ / % of account
* TP1 / TP2 (prices & pips)
* Result (TP1, TP2, SL, manual exit)
* R:R achieved
* Notes: reason for entry, what went right/wrong

---

## 10) Weekly review process

* Each week, review **all trades** in the journal.
* Calculate win rate, average R:R, expectancy: `Expectancy = (Win% √ó AvgWin) ‚àí (Loss% √ó AvgLoss)`.
* If expectancy < 0, lower risk, tighten rules, and backtest the method again.

---

## 11) Quick rules summary (TL;DR)

1. **Mark daily close** every day.
2. **Trade direction**: bullish daily ‚Üí look to buy **below** the close; bearish daily ‚Üí look to sell **above** the close.
3. **Confirm on lower TF** with BOS + retest, imbalance open, or 1-2-3.
4. **SL** must be logical (swing/imbalance). **Risk ‚â§ 1%** per trade.
5. **TP1 at 1R**, take partial, trail remainder to 2R+.
6. **Journal every trade** and review weekly.

* Turn this into a one-page printable checklist/PDF, or
* Produce a filled example trade (with chart sketches) to show the exact markings and entry/SL/TP placements.

Mar Angwen  
Alright ‚Äî that was a **lot** of information to process, so let‚Äôs break it down clearly.
This teacher was explaining a **daily candle trading method** ‚Äî basically, how to use the daily candlestick to plan intraday entries (usually on the 5-minute chart).

---

## üîπ Step 1: Understand Candle Structure

Every candlestick ‚Äî no matter the timeframe ‚Äî has four key points:

* **Open** ‚Äì where the candle starts.
* **High** ‚Äì the highest price reached during the candle.
* **Low** ‚Äì the lowest price reached during the candle.
* **Close** ‚Äì where the candle ends.

The order in which these are created depends on whether the candle ends up bullish or bearish:

| Type               | Order of Formation                                                                                            | Meaning                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Bullish candle** | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Opens ‚Üí 2Ô∏è‚É£ Moves down to make the **Low** ‚Üí 3Ô∏è‚É£ Moves up to make the **High** ‚Üí 4Ô∏è‚É£ Closes at the top    | Candle ends green (price rose overall) |
| **Bearish candle** | 1Ô∏è‚É£ Opens ‚Üí 2Ô∏è‚É£ Moves up to make the **High** ‚Üí 3Ô∏è‚É£ Moves down to make the **Low** ‚Üí 4Ô∏è‚É£ Closes at the bottom | Candle ends red (price fell overall)   |

---

## üîπ Step 2: Why This Matters for Daily Candles

When the **daily candle closes at midnight (or 1 AM for synthetic indices)**, a new daily candle begins.
The idea is that the new daily candle will **first move in the opposite direction** to create its wick (low or high), **then go in its true direction** for the day.

So:

* If the new day will be **bullish**, price usually dips first ‚Üí creates the **low of the day** ‚Üí then moves upward.
* If the new day will be **bearish**, price usually spikes up first ‚Üí creates the **high of the day** ‚Üí then drops.

This ‚Äúfirst move opposite the final direction‚Äù helps you time early entries.

---

## üîπ Step 3: Mark the Daily Candle‚Äôs **Closing Price**

When the daily candle closes:

* Draw a horizontal line at the **closing price**.

That line is your **reference point** for the next day.

---

## üîπ Step 4: The Core Trading Rule

Once you‚Äôve marked the **previous day‚Äôs closing price**, watch how the new daily candle behaves:

| Previous Candle | What to Look For                                                        | Trade Zone                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Bullish**     | The next candle will likely dip below the close to form the day‚Äôs low   | Look for **buy setups below** the close  |
| **Bearish**     | The next candle will likely rise above the close to form the day‚Äôs high | Look for **sell setups above** the close |

This works because the market tends to ‚Äúwick‚Äù in the opposite direction before continuing the main move.

---

## üîπ Step 5: Drop to a Lower Timeframe (like 5 min)

On the 5-minute chart, you look for confirmation patterns (‚Äúmodel formations‚Äù) **around the daily close level**:

* **Break of structure (BoS)**
* **Liquidity sweep**
* **Imbalance fill**
* **Retest of order block / fair value gap**, etc.

These small-timeframe confirmations give you a tight entry with a small stop loss (maybe 4‚Äì6 pips).

---

## üîπ Step 6: Trade Management

Once your entry is confirmed:

* Place stop loss just above/below the structure.
* Aim for a **1:3 risk-to-reward ratio** (risk 1 unit to make 3 units).

You don‚Äôt need to hold all day ‚Äî the method is designed to catch the ‚Äúwick‚Äù or main leg of the daily candle.

---

## üîπ Step 7: Practical Example

Let‚Äôs say yesterday‚Äôs daily candle was **bullish** and closed at 1.2500.

* At 1 AM, a new candle opens at 1.2500.
* Price dips to 1.2480 (below the close) ‚Üí forms the low of the day.
* On 5-minute chart, you spot a **break of structure upward** and a small **imbalance** around 1.2480.
* You **buy at 1.2485**, stop loss 1.2475, target 1.2520 (1:3 R:R).
* Price rallies ‚Üí your trade rides the daily candle‚Äôs bullish move.

---

## üîπ Step 8: Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Every candle has open, high, low, close ‚Äî formation order matters.
‚úÖ The daily candle often starts by moving *opposite* the final direction.
‚úÖ Mark the **daily close** line to guide your intraday bias.
‚úÖ Use 5-minute confirmations to enter precisely.
‚úÖ Aim for clean 1:3 trades ‚Äî no need to chase every candle.
