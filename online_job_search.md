# 💡 If I Lost Everything, Here’s Exactly What I’d Do to Make My First $100 on Gumroad (From Scratch)

*Always prepare for the worst — because it can happen anytime.*

**By Ayo** · *5 min read · 2 days ago*

---

I think about this sometimes —
what if I woke up tomorrow and everything was gone?

No followers.
No products.
No email list.
Nothing.

Just a phone, an internet connection, and a brain packed with lessons from past mistakes.

Scary?
Yeah.
But also... kind of exciting.

Because if I had to start again from absolute zero, I know *exactly* what I’d do to make my first $100 online — using Gumroad (or **Selar**, if you’re in Africa).

Let’s rebuild it from scratch, step by step.

---

## Step 1: Forget Fancy — Start Simple

If I’m starting over, I don’t need a logo, a website, or a team.
What I *do* need is a real problem people want solved — and a simple product that solves it fast.

People don’t buy “products.”
They buy **shortcuts**.

* Busy creators pay for templates.
* Confused beginners pay for guides.
* Overwhelmed marketers pay for systems.

So I’d grab a notebook (or open Google Docs) and list everything I know — even the “small” skills.

Then I’d ask:

* “What do people always ask me about?”
* “What would someone rather pay for than figure out alone?”

That’s where your first digital product idea hides.

---

## Step 2: Create a “Quick Win” Product

Here’s a truth most beginners ignore:
You don’t need a masterpiece to make money.
You just need something that delivers a **quick win** — ideally in 10 minutes or less.

Proven ideas:

* **Notion templates** (planners, trackers, content calendars)
* **Mini eBooks or guides** (how to start, how to grow, how to fix)
* **Prompt packs** (for ChatGPT, Midjourney, or marketing tasks)
* **Checklists or swipe files** (for social media posts, emails, etc.)

Keep it simple.
A $10–$20 product that fixes one annoying problem can make your first $100 way faster than chasing perfection.

---

## Step 3: Build It in One Day

No endless planning.
Just one focused day of creating.

Use:

* **Canva** → visuals or templates
* **Google Docs / Notion** → guides or planners
* **ChatGPT** → outlines, structure, or editing help

When it’s done, don’t aim for perfect.
Aim for **helpful**.

*Done and helpful beats beautiful and unfinished.*

---

## Step 4: Set Up on Gumroad (or Selar)

Now it’s time to go live.

Gumroad makes it ridiculously easy — almost criminally so.

1. Create a free account at [gumroad.com](https://gumroad.com)
   *(Or use [Selar.co](https://selar.co) if you’re in Africa — better local payments.)*
2. Click **“New Product.”**
3. Upload your file.
4. Write a short, emotional description — focus on the problem it solves.
5. Add 2–3 mockup images (Canva is perfect for this).
6. Set your price between **$10–$20.**

That’s it — you’re officially part of the digital economy.
No inventory. No investors. Just you, your ideas, and the internet.

---

## Step 5: Promote — The Fun (and Free) Part

Most people post once and quit.
That’s like opening a restaurant and telling only one friend.

If I lost everything, I’d promote like a **human**, not a salesman.

**Here’s how:**

### 1. Reddit

Join subreddits in your niche (e.g., r/Notion, r/SideHustle, r/AITools).
Give genuine advice first.
Then naturally mention your product when relevant.

> I once made $100 from a single helpful Reddit comment that linked to my Gumroad page.

### 2. Twitter/X

Post short, valuable threads.
Example:

> “5 Free Tools I Used to Create a Notion Template That Sold 40 Copies on Gumroad.”

Simple, transparent posts like that perform surprisingly well.

### 3. TikTok or Reels

Show your product in action.
People love “behind the scenes” videos — even 200 views can bring your first few buyers.

### 4. Facebook Groups / WhatsApp Communities

Lead with value. Then soft-sell.

> “I built a Notion planner that helps creators stay consistent — happy to share if anyone’s interested.”

---

## Step 6: Follow Up and Build Trust

After your first few sales, **don’t vanish.**

Message your buyers or email them (if you collected emails). Ask:

* “What did you love about the product?”
* “What could I improve?”

That’s how you turn a $100 hustle into a $1,000 business — by listening and improving.

People support creators who treat them like humans, not ATMs.

---

## Step 7: Reinvent and Repeat

When that first $100 hits your balance, you’ll feel it — that rush that says,

> “I can actually do this.”

Now use that momentum.

Every product teaches you something new:
what sells, what flops, what people truly need.

Repeat the process — smarter, faster, simpler.

That’s how $100 becomes $1,000.
Then $10,000.
Then freedom.

---

## Final Thoughts

If I lost everything, I wouldn’t panic.

I’d grab a notebook, create something useful, list it on Gumroad or Selar, and talk about it everywhere.

Because the internet doesn’t care where you’re starting from.
It rewards those who **show up** and **solve problems.**

You don’t need followers.
You don’t need luck.
You just need a plan — and the guts to press *“publish.”*

Your first $100 is already waiting.
All you have to do is start.
