# ✅ **HTF Wick Strategy — Step-by-Step Trading Checklist (Beginner Version)**  


# **📌 STEP 1 — Determine Trend/Bias (Higher Timeframe)**  

### **On the 4H & Daily chart:**  

* ☐ Is price **below** the 50 EMA AND the EMA sloping down?  
  → **Bias = SELL only**  
* ☐ Is price **above** the 50 EMA AND the EMA sloping up?  
  → **Bias = BUY only**  

✔ Only trade in ONE direction per session  
✔ NO countertrend trades  


# **📌 STEP 2 — Wait for a New 4H Candle to Open**  

4H candles start at:  
**02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00** (broker time varies)  

* ☐ Has a new 4H candle opened?  

If **SELL BIAS** → expect price to push UP first (form top wick)  
If **BUY BIAS** → expect price to push DOWN first (form bottom wick)  

**Do NOT enter before the manipulation/wick forms.**  


# **📌 STEP 3 — Mark Your Setup Area (Fair Value Gaps)**  

Switch to **5-minute or 15-minute chart**:  

* ☐ Mark the most recent unmitigated FVG located near previous swing high/low  

If **SELLING:**  

* ☐ Mark the nearest FVG *above* current price  

If **BUYING:**  

* ☐ Mark the nearest FVG *below* current price  

**Only trade if price taps into that FVG.**  


# **📌 STEP 4 — Wait for Price to Tap the FVG**  

* ☐ Has price reached the FVG zone?  
  → If *no*, **NO trade**  

Once price taps:  

* For **SELL**: price must tap UP into the FVG  
* For **BUY**: price must tap DOWN into the FVG  

This is the wick of the HTF candle.  


# **📌 STEP 5 — Look for Simple LTF Confirmation (1M–3M chart)**  

Switch to 1M–3M:  

### **SELL Confirmation Checklist**  

* ☐ Price entered FVG  
* ☐ Price rejected and moved down  
* ☐ A recent **structure low is broken**  

### **BUY Confirmation Checklist**  

* ☐ Price entered FVG  
* ☐ Price rejected and moved up  
* ☐ A recent **structure high is broken**  

If this does NOT happen → **NO trade**.  


# **📌 STEP 6 — Entry & Stop Loss**  

### **SELL Entry**  

* ☐ Enter after pullback following BOS (break of structure)  
* ☐ Stop loss above the wick that tapped the FVG  

### **BUY Entry**  

* ☐ Enter after pullback following BOS  
* ☐ Stop loss below the wick that tapped the FVG  

Stops should be clean and small.  


# **📌 STEP 7 — Take Profit Target**  

Choose ONE:  

* ☐ Previous swing low/high (safest)  
* ☐ 2R–3R (balanced and reliable)  
* ☐ 4H candle completion (advanced / higher reward)  


# **📌 STEP 8 — Post-Trade Review**  

After trade closes, evaluate:  

* ☐ Did I follow the bias rules?  
* ☐ Did I wait for a 4H candle?  
* ☐ Did I ONLY trade after tapping the FVG?  
* ☐ Did I wait for confirmation?  
* ☐ Did I avoid impulsive entries?  


# ⭐ Summary: The Only Things You Need  

* **Trend from 4H & Daily (50 EMA)**  
* **New 4H candle opening**  
* **Clear 5m–15m FVG**  
* **LTF confirmation (BOS)**  
* **Simple SL + 2R–3R TP**  

This is the simplest and safest way for beginners to trade the HTF wick concept.

# Strategy: 2  

## ✅ Choppy Market Range-Bounce Strategy — Step-by-Step Checklist (Beginner Version)  

### 📌 STEP 1 — Identify the Range (H1/H4)  
* ☐ Mark clear Support zone  
* ☐ Mark clear Resistance zone  
* ☐ Range width must be obvious and wide enough (not less than 40 pips)  

### 📌 STEP 2 — Check Market Condition  
* ☐ Is the 200 EMA flat?
* ☐ No major trend on Daily timeframe (price not making strong higher highs/lower lows)  
* ☐ Price has touched Support/Resistance atleast 2 times?  
* ☐ Is price bouncing between Support/Resistance?  
* If “yes” → proceed.  
* If “no” → skip.  

### 📌 STEP 3 — Prepare for Trade at the Edges  
BUY Setup  
* ☐ Wait for price to touch Support  
* ☐ Confirm RSI oversold (below 30)  
* ☐ Look for bullish rejection candle  
* ☐ Rejection candle pattern is clear (pin bar, engulfing, hammer/star)

SELL Setup  
* ☐ Wait for price to touch Resistance  
* ☐ Confirm RSI overbought (above 70)  
* ☐ Look for bearish rejection candle
* ☐ Rejection candle pattern is clear (pin bar, engulfing, hammer/star)  

### 📌 STEP 4 — Entry  
* ☐ Enter **only after** the rejection candle closes  
* ☐ No entries mid-range  
* ☐ No entries early  

### 📌 STEP 5 — Stop Loss  
* ☐ SL placed outside the Support/Resistance zone  
* ☐ Added 5–10 pip safety padding  

### 📌 STEP 6 — Take Profit  
Choose one:  
* ☐ TP1: Mid-range (quick, safe)  
* ☐ TP2: Opposite zone (full move)  

### 📌 STEP 7 — Risk Rules  
* ☐ Risk max 1% per trade  
* ☐ No revenge trades  
* ☐ No trading during major news releases  

### 📌 STEP 8 — Review After the Trade  
* ☐ Did I trade only at the edges?  
* ☐ Did I wait for RSI + candle confirmation?  
* ☐ Did I avoid trading in the middle?  
* ☐ Did I follow SL/TP rules?  

⭐ **Summary: The Only Things You Need**  
- Clear range  
- Flat 200 EMA  
- Edges only  
- RSI confirmation  
- Simple SL outside range  
- TP mid-range or opposite edge

# Strategy: 3  

## Quick Reference: Choppy Market Trading Strategy

### SETUP (Do Once)
- **Timeframe**: 4-hour chart
- **Pairs**: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, or USD/JPY only
- **Indicators**: 
  - Bollinger Bands (20, 2)
  - RSI (14)
  - Moving Average (50)

---

### STEP 1: Open Chart & Identify Market Type
- Look at the chart - is price moving sideways in a range?
- Check if Bollinger Bands are parallel (not widening/narrowing rapidly)
- If yes = ranging/choppy market → continue
- If no = skip trading today

---

### STEP 2: Wait for Price to Reach Extreme Zones
- **For BUY**: Wait for price to touch/cross lower Bollinger Band
- **For SELL**: Wait for price to touch/cross upper Bollinger Band
- Set price alerts if not there yet and walk away

---

### STEP 3: Check RSI Confirmation
- **For BUY**: RSI must be below 30 (oversold)
- **For SELL**: RSI must be above 70 (overbought)
- If RSI is between 30-70 → No trade, wait

---

### STEP 4: Wait for Reversal Candle
- **For BUY**: Wait for a strong green/bullish candle at lower band
- **For SELL**: Wait for a strong red/bearish candle at upper band
- Patience! Don't jump in immediately

---

### STEP 5: Enter Trade
- Enter when the next candle opens after the reversal candle
- Enter only 1% of your account risk

---

### STEP 6: Set Stop Loss Immediately
- **For BUY**: Place stop loss 20-30 pips below the lower Bollinger Band
- **For SELL**: Place stop loss 20-30 pips above the upper Bollinger Band

---

### STEP 7: Set Take Profit
- **Target 1** (50% position): Middle MA line
- **Target 2** (remaining 50%): Opposite Bollinger Band (but exit 10-20 pips before)

---

### STEP 8: Walk Away
- Don't watch every tick
- Let the trade run
- Check only 2-3 times per day

# Strategy: 4
## Quick Reference: Daily Candle Entry Strategy (Beginner-Friendly)

### SETUP (Do Once)

* **Timeframe**: Daily chart to identify zones, drop to 5-min or 15-min for entries
* **Pairs / Markets**: Any liquid market (Forex, indices, crypto)
* **Indicators**: None required (price-action based), optional small EMA for structure reference

---

### STEP 1: Mark Daily Candle Close

* Wait for the **previous daily candle to fully close**
* Draw a horizontal line at the **closing price**
* This will be your **key reference zone**

---

### STEP 2: Determine Bias

* **Bullish daily close** → look to **buy below the close**
* **Bearish daily close** → look to **sell above the close**
* Do not trade against the daily bias

---

### STEP 3: Drop to Lower Timeframe

* Use **5-minute or 15-minute charts**
* Watch how price behaves around the daily close zone

---

### STEP 4: Wait for Entry Signal

* **For BUY below bullish close**:

  * Price dips below daily close line
  * Look for small **rejection candles**, **wicks**, or minor **structure shift**
* **For SELL above bearish close**:

  * Price rises above daily close line
  * Look for small **rejection candles**, **wicks**, or minor **structure shift**
* Optional: Enter at **imbalance / liquidity grab** if visible

---

### STEP 5: Enter Trade

* Enter when the lower timeframe shows **confirmation of reversal**
* Risk **1–2% of account per trade**

---

### STEP 6: Set Stop Loss Immediately

* Place stop loss **just beyond the wick or structure extreme**
* Typically **5–10 pips for Forex**, adjust for volatility

---

### STEP 7: Set Take Profit

* Target **1:2 or 1:3 risk-reward ratio**
* Optionally use next **minor swing high/low** on lower timeframe as TP

---

### STEP 8: Walk Away

* Mark your levels and **don’t over-monitor**
* Let price move
* Adjust TP if market structure changes, but do not chase trades

---

This method simplifies daily candle entries, uses **low-risk zones**, and gives beginners a **structured way to trade without relying on complex indicators**.

# Strategy: 5  
---

### SETUP (Do Once)

* **Timeframes**:

  * Daily (D1) → direction
  * 1 Hour (1H) → entry
* **Pairs**: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD
* **Indicators**:

  * Session Indicator (Asia, London, New York)
* **Risk**: 1% per trade
* **RR**: Fixed 1:3

---

### STEP 1: Check Direction on Daily (Very Simple)

* Open **Daily chart**
* Look only at the **last 2 candles**

  * **Bullish bias**:

    * Today’s candle closed **above yesterday’s high**
  * **Bearish bias**:

    * Today’s candle closed **below yesterday’s low**
* If neither → **NO TRADE**
* Do **not** analyze trends, HH/HL, or patterns

---

### STEP 2: Mark Yesterday’s Range

* On the **Daily chart**:

  * Draw a horizontal line at **yesterday’s high**
  * Draw a horizontal line at **yesterday’s low**
* This box is your **only trading area**
* Do nothing else on Daily

---

### STEP 3: Go to 1H Before London Open

* Switch to **1H timeframe**
* Be on charts **before London opens**
* Turn on **Session Indicator**
* Focus only on:

  * End of **Asian session**
  * Start of **London session**

---

### STEP 4: Wait for Liquidity Sweep (Key Beginner Rule)

* **Bullish setup**:

  * Price dips below **yesterday’s low** OR **Asian low**
  * Then closes back **inside the range**
* **Bearish setup**:

  * Price moves above **yesterday’s high** OR **Asian high**
  * Then closes back **inside the range**
* If no sweep → **NO TRADE**

---

### STEP 5: Confirm With Candle Close (No Structure Needed)

* **Bullish trade**:

  * A strong **bullish candle** closes after the sweep
* **Bearish trade**:

  * A strong **bearish candle** closes after the sweep
* Do **not** wait for break of structure
* Candle close is enough for beginners

---

### STEP 6: Enter Trade

* Enter **at the close** of the confirmation candle
* Risk **only 1%**
* One trade per pair per day (max)

---

### STEP 7: Set Stop Loss & Take Profit

* **Stop Loss**:

  * BUY → below the sweep low
  * SELL → above the sweep high
* **Take Profit**:

  * Fixed **1:3 Risk–Reward**
* No trailing stop
* No moving TP

---

### STEP 8: Walk Away

* Once trade is placed:

  * Do not manage
  * Do not watch lower timeframes
* Check result later

---

## Beginner Rules (Very Important)

* Trade **only London session**
* Skip days with:

  * Big news (NFP, CPI, FOMC)
  * Very small daily candles
* Journal **every trade**
* Judge strategy only after **30 trades**  

---
---
---
# Strategy: 6  

Once the alert fires, you **do not rush**. You go through a checklist.

### A. Trend Filter (Non-negotiable)  
* Price above 200 EMA = buy trade only
* Price below 200 EMA = sell trade only
* Price within ±50 pips of 200 EMA = no trade (indecision zone)

### B. RSI Signal
* RSI < 30 (for buy in uptrend only)
* RSI > 70 (for sell in downtrend only)

### C. Price Action (mandatory)
For BUY (Pick one):
* Bullish engulfing (body must be 1.5x average candle)
* Rejection wick (wick must be 2x body size minimum)

For SELL (Pick one):
* Bearish engulfing (body must be 1.5x average candle)
* Rejection wick (wick must be 2x body size minimum)

If no price action is met → **no trade**  

### D. One extra confirmation (Pick only one- not all)
* MACD crossover in direction of trade or
* MACD histogram must flip in trade direction of trade or
* Volume spike towards the direction of trade  

### E. Entry (Where to enter trade)
* For Buy: Must be at support zone (previous low/demand area)
* Sell: Must be at resistance zone (previous high/supply area)
  
### F. Stop Loss & Take Profit
**Stop Loss**
* For Buy → below recent swing low
* For Sell → above recent swing high

**Take Profit**
* Minimum **1:2 risk-to-reward** or
* Next support/resistance level

## How to activate alerts  

## 🔧 PART 1: ADDING THE SCRIPT

### **Step 1: Open Pine Editor**

1. Go to [TradingView.com](https://www.tradingview.com)
2. Open any chart (EUR/USD, whatever)
3. At the bottom of the screen, click **"Pine Editor"** tab
   - If you don't see it, click the **`</>`** icon at the bottom toolbar

### **Step 2: Create New Indicator**

1. In the Pine Editor, you'll see some default code
2. Click **"Open"** dropdown (top left of Pine Editor)
3. Select **"New indicator"**
4. **Delete ALL the default code** that appears

### **Step 3: Paste the Enhanced Script**

1. Copy the entire Pine Script (from `//@version=5` to the last line)
2. Paste it into the empty Pine Editor
3. Click **"Save"** (disk icon at top)
4. Name it: `RSI Strategy - Enhanced` (or whatever you want)

### **Step 4: Add to Chart**

1. Click **"Add to Chart"** button (top right of Pine Editor)
2. The indicator should now appear:
   - **On the main chart**: You'll see the 200 EMA line (orange)
   - **BUY/SELL signals**: Green "BUY" labels below bars, Red "SELL" labels above bars
   - **Background shading**: Slight green tint in uptrends, red in downtrends
   - **Stop Loss & Take Profit levels**: Crosses appear when signals fire

---

## 🔔 PART 2: SETTING UP ALERTS (CRITICAL!)

### **Step 1: Open Alert Menu**

1. Look at the **top toolbar** of your chart
2. Click the **alarm clock icon** (🔔) or press `Alt + A`
3. A popup window opens: "Create Alert"

### **Step 2: Configure the Alert**

In the alert setup window:

#### **Condition Section:**
- **First dropdown**: Select e.g `RSI Strategy - Enhanced` (your script name)
- **Second dropdown**: You'll see two options:
  - **`BUY Signal`** ← Select this for buy entries
  - **`SELL Signal`** ← Select this for sell entries

*You need to create TWO separate alerts (one for BUY, one for SELL)*

#### **Options Section:**
- **"Only Once"**: ❌ DON'T use this
- **"Once Per Bar"**: ❌ Not ideal
- **"Once Per Bar Close"**: ✅ **SELECT THIS** (prevents false signals from wicks)

#### **Expiration:**
- Set to **"Open-ended"** (never expires)

#### **Alert Actions:**
Check these boxes:
- ✅ **Notify on App** (if you have TradingView mobile app)
- ✅ **Show Popup** (desktop alert)
- ✅ **Send Email** (optional but recommended)
- ❌ **Play Sound** (annoying if you're watching charts)
- ❌ **Send Email-to-SMS** (unless you want text messages)

#### **Alert Name:**
Give it a clear name:
- Example: `EUR/USD 1H - BUY Signal`
- Example: `GBP/JPY 4H - SELL Signal`

#### **Message:**
The default message I included has this format:
```
🟢 BUY SIGNAL on EURUSD 1H
✅ RSI Oversold
✅ Uptrend (>200EMA)
✅ Bullish Pattern
✅ MACD Bullish
SL: 1.0850
TP1: 1.0920
TP2: 1.0975
```

**Don't change this** — it's already formatted to give you all the info you need.

### **Step 3: Create the Alert**

1. Click **"Create"** at the bottom
2. **Repeat Steps 1-3** for the SELL signal (remember you need only TWO alerts total per chart i.e `buy` and `sell`)

---

## 📱 PART 3: MOBILE APP SETUP (OPTIONAL BUT USEFUL)

If you want alerts on your phone:

1. Download **TradingView app** (iOS/Android)
2. Log in with the same account
3. Go to **Profile → Settings → Notifications**
4. Enable **"Push Notifications"**
5. Make sure alerts are ON for your watchlist

Now you'll get phone notifications when signals fire.

---

## ⚙️ PART 4: CUSTOMIZING THE INDICATOR SETTINGS

You might want to tweak some parameters. Here's how:

### **Step 1: Open Indicator Settings**

1. On your chart, find the indicator name in the **top-left overlay list**
2. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to "RSI Strategy - Enhanced"
3. A settings menu opens

### **Step 2: Key Parameters you can Adjust if you like**

Here's what each setting does:

| Parameter | Default | What It Does | When to Change |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **RSI Length** | 14 | Sensitivity of RSI | Lower = more signals (noisier), Higher = fewer signals |
| **RSI Oversold** | 30 | Buy trigger level | In strong uptrends, try 35-40 |
| **RSI Overbought** | 70 | Sell trigger level | In strong downtrends, try 60-65 |
| **Trend Filter EMA** | 200 | Long-term trend | 100 for faster trends, 200 for major trends |
| **ATR Length** | 14 | Volatility measure | Keep at 14 (standard) |
| **ATR Multiplier** | 1.5 | Stop loss distance | 1.5 = tighter stops, 2.0 = wider stops |

### **My Recommendation:**
**Don't change anything yet.** Test with defaults first, then adjust based on your backtest results.

## 🎯 PART 5: TESTING THE SETUP

Before you trust this with real money:

### **Immediate Test:**

1. **Scroll back in time** on your chart (click and drag the chart left)
2. Look for past BUY/SELL signals
3. **Manually check each one:**
   - Did it respect the 200 EMA trend filter?
   - Was there actually a bullish/bearish pattern?
   - Would the stop loss have been hit?
   - Did it reach TP1? TP2?

### **Demo Test:**

1. Open a **TradingView Paper Trading account** (fake money)
2. When you get an alert, **place the trade** in paper trading
3. Track results in a spreadsheet for at least **50 trades**

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES (AVOID THESE)

### ❌ **Mistake #1: Using "Any Alert Function Call"**
Some people select "Any alert() function call" instead of the specific signal. **Don't do this.** You want only BUY or SELL signals, not every calculation.

### ❌ **Mistake #2: Not Using "Once Per Bar Close"**
If you use "Once Per Bar," you'll get alerts **while the candle is forming**, which leads to false signals. Always wait for bar close.

### ❌ **Mistake #3: Setting Alerts on Multiple Timeframes with Same Pair**
Don't create EUR/USD 15M, 1H, 4H alerts all at once. Pick **ONE timeframe** per pair to avoid confusion.

### ❌ **Mistake #4: Ignoring Alerts in Chop**
Just because the script fires an alert doesn't mean you **must** trade it. If the market looks choppy or you're unsure, **skip it.** The script is a tool, not a robot master.

### ❌ **Mistake #5: Not Checking Price Action Yourself**
The script detects patterns, but **you need to visually confirm**:
- Is the engulfing candle strong or weak?
- Is the rejection wick clean or messy?
- Are we at actual support/resistance?

**Never blindly follow alerts.**

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: No signals appearing**
**Causes:**
- Market is ranging near 200 EMA (no clear trend)
- RSI not hitting 30/70 levels (low volatility)
- MACD not confirming (momentum misalignment)

**Solution:** This is normal. Good strategies don't signal every day. Wait.

### **Problem: Too many signals**
**Causes:**
- Timeframe too low (5M/15M = noise)
- Choppy market conditions

**Solution:** Move to higher timeframe (1H minimum, 4H ideal for swing trading)

### **Problem: Alerts not firing**
**Causes:**
- Alert set to "Only Once" and already fired
- Wrong condition selected
- TradingView session expired

**Solution:** 
- Delete and recreate alert
- Make sure condition is "BUY Signal" or "SELL Signal"
- Stay logged into TradingView (doesn't need to be active, just logged in)

### **Problem: Alert fired but no visual signal on chart**
**Causes:**
- You're looking at wrong timeframe
- You zoomed in/out and can't see the label

**Solution:** Check the alert message — it tells you the timeframe. Match it exactly.

**You're now set up.** But remember: **The script is only 20% of success.** The other 80% is your discipline, risk management, and ability to sit on your hands when conditions aren't right. Most traders fail because they overtrade, not because their strategy is bad.
