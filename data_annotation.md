## Data Annotation

**Data annotation** is the process of labeling objects in images or videos using boxes, polygons, or segmentation masks to train AI models. These models are used in applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, security systems, machine vision, and other computer vision technologies.

### Platforms and Tools

To work on data annotation projects, you typically use:

* **CVAT** – An open-source annotation platform widely used in the industry
* **Client-specific platforms** – Proprietary tools provided directly by companies

### Finding Data Annotation Work

Common clients and platforms offering annotation projects include:

* **AVALA**
* **Scale AI, Labelbox, Appen, and other outsourcing providers** (availability varies by region and contract)

## Getting Started With a Data Annotation Project

### Prerequisites

Before beginning any annotation task:
* The client will provide the images or videos to be annotated
* You'll receive annotation guidelines and requirements
* You'll be given access credentials to the annotation platform

### Accessing the Platform

1. Open your web browser
2. Log in to the client's platform (or CVAT if specified)
3. Review the project instructions carefully

**Note:** Some clients provide pre-configured CVAT accounts with the project already set up. Others supply only the raw data and instructions, requiring you to configure the environment yourself.

## Setting Up a Project on CVAT

If you need to configure the project manually, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your CVAT account
2. Navigate to the **Tasks** tab and select **Create New Project**
3. **Name your project** using a clear, descriptive title
4. **Upload media files** – Import the images or videos provided by the client
5. **Configure labels** – Define the object categories you'll be annotating
6. **Assign colors** – Give each label a distinct color for easy visual differentiation
7. **Add attributes** – Include any required metadata fields (e.g., object size, visibility, occlusion level)
8. Click **Submit and Open** to save the project to the CVAT server
9. **Enable Auto-Save** in settings to prevent data loss during annotation

## Types of Annotation Tasks

Depending on the project requirements, you may perform:

* **Object tracking** – Following objects across multiple video frames
* **Semantic segmentation** – Painting or masking specific regions or full objects
* **Instance segmentation** – Outlining individual objects with polygons
* **Bounding boxes** – Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest
* **Keypoint annotation** – Marking specific points on objects (e.g., facial landmarks)
* **Custom tasks** – Client-specific labeling requirements

### Annotation Workflow

1. Select the appropriate tool (box, polygon, brush, etc.)
2. Draw or mark the object according to instructions
3. Assign the correct label and attributes
4. Press **Done** or use keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `N` for next frame, `Ctrl+S` to save)
5. Review your work for accuracy before moving to the next item

## Submitting Your Work

Once all annotations are complete and quality-checked:

1. **Review** the entire project to ensure all guidelines were followed
2. **Download** the completed project files from the platform
3. **Compress** the files into a `.zip` archive
4. **Submit** the archive to the client via the specified method (email, client portal, etc.)
5. **Request payment** according to your agreed-upon terms, or wait for the client's standard payment processing

### Quality Checklist Before Submission

- [ ] All required objects are annotated
- [ ] Labels and attributes are correctly assigned
- [ ] No frames or images are skipped
- [ ] Annotations follow client guidelines precisely
- [ ] Files are properly named and organized
