> You are an Excel and inventory management expert.
> I am in charge of stores at ASTU and I want to create an **automated Excel inventory management system**.
> The Excel workbook should:

> 1. Automatically **update stock balances** when items are received or issued.
> 2. Reduce stock levels when items are **issued to officers** and show the **real-time balance**.
> 3. Increase stock levels when **new stock is received** and update the balance automatically.
> 4. Keep a **record of issued items**, including:

>    * Item name
>    * Quantity issued
>    * Name of officer
>    * Date of issue
>    * Issue receipt number
> 5. Keep a **record of received items**, including:

>    * Item name
>    * Quantity received
>    * Date received
>    * Receipt number
> 6. Allow tracking of **who received what item and on which date**.
> 7. Clearly display **current stock balance** for each item.

> The Excel system should include:

> * A **master stock sheet**
> * A **receiving (inward) sheet**
> * An **issuing (outward) sheet**
> * A **Dashboard**
> * Formulas (and VBA if necessary) to automate calculations

* **Receive Stock form**
