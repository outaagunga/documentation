# Writing a news story  
Here’s a clear step-by-step breakdown of the process — from idea generation to publication:  

---

### 🧠 **1. Idea Generation**

**Goal:** Find a story worth telling.

* **Look for newsworthiness:** Think *timeliness, impact, proximity, conflict, novelty, prominence.*
* **Sources of ideas:**

  * Current events, press releases, social media, community meetings, public records.
  * Tips from readers or colleagues.
  * Trends, data, or human-interest angles.
* **Ask:** “Why should readers care about this now?”

---

### 🔎 **2. Research & Backgrounding**

**Goal:** Understand the story before reporting it.

* Gather background info: previous coverage, official reports, data, and historical context.
* Identify key people, organizations, and documents involved.
* Learn enough to ask smart questions during interviews.

---

### 🎤 **3. Reporting (Information Gathering)**

**Goal:** Collect facts, voices, and evidence.

* **Interviews:** Talk to multiple, credible sources (officials, witnesses, experts, affected people).
* **Observation:** Visit the scene, take notes on what you see, hear, and feel.
* **Documents & data:** Verify all statistics and quotes.
* **Record accurately:** Use notes, recordings, or both.

---

### 🧩 **4. Angle & Story Planning**

**Goal:** Decide how to tell the story.

* Identify your **angle** — the central idea or focus of your piece.

  * Example: Instead of “local bridge repairs,” your angle could be “residents frustrated over year-long bridge delays.”
* Choose the **story type:** breaking news, feature, investigative, profile, analysis, etc.
* Outline your structure: decide what information goes where.

---

### ✍️ **5. Writing the Story**

**Goal:** Craft a clear, accurate, and engaging article.

#### Typical Structure:

1. **Headline:** Short, accurate, and attention-grabbing.
2. **Lead (Lede):** First sentence/paragraph — tells the most important fact or sums up the story.
3. **Nut Graph:** Explains why the story matters (often follows the lead).
4. **Body:** Provides details, quotes, and background in logical order (often using the *inverted pyramid* — most important info first).
5. **Conclusion:** Wraps up with context or a forward-looking statement.

#### Writing Tips:

* Use clear, concise, factual language.
* Attribute all opinions and disputed facts.
* Avoid jargon and bias.
* Check names, titles, dates, and figures carefully.

---

### 🕵️ **6. Fact-Checking & Editing**

**Goal:** Ensure accuracy, fairness, and clarity.

* Verify every detail and quote.
* Ensure balance (include multiple perspectives).
* Check grammar, spelling, and style (usually AP Style for news).
* Have an editor review for structure, flow, and tone.

---

### 🧾 **7. Legal & Ethical Checks**

**Goal:** Avoid libel, invasion of privacy, and bias.

* Ensure all claims are supported by evidence.
* Avoid plagiarism; credit all sources.
* Confirm consent for sensitive material (photos, minors, victims, etc.).

---

### 🌐 **8. Publishing**

**Goal:** Deliver your story to readers effectively.

* Prepare digital elements: photos, videos, graphics, links, SEO keywords.
* Upload to the publication’s CMS (content management system).
* Coordinate with editors or producers for timing and promotion (social media, newsletters, etc.).
* Monitor audience feedback and correct errors promptly if necessary.

---

### 🔁 **9. Post-Publication Follow-Up**

**Goal:** Keep the story alive and accountable.

* Track developments and reader reactions.
* Publish updates or corrections if needed.
* Consider follow-up stories or deeper investigations.

---
