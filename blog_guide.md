Prompt:

Critically review the text and perform the following checks, focusing on where the language might be flagged by a sophisticated plagiarism tool:
>1.	High-Similarity Phrase Review: Identify and list five to ten specific sentences or long phrases that are highly generic, clichéd, or strongly echo existing published works. For each, provide a brief suggestion to rephrase or restructure the sentence to ensure originality.
>2.	Uncited Knowledge Check: Point out any section or paragraph (particularly those covering statistics, facts, or niche concepts) where the information is not common knowledge and clearly requires an in-text citation or attribution.
>3.	Self-Correction Assessment: Analyze the flow and structure. Does any section read as if it was paraphrased too closely from a single source, even if a dedicated tool can't find a direct match? If so, recommend a strategy to make the voice distinctly my own.
