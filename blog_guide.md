### **STEP 1: Idea Generation & Topic Selection**

**Goal:** Find a blog topic that is popular, interesting, and relevant to your niche.

**Action Steps:**

1. Open your AI chat tool (like ChatGPT).
2. Type this prompt:

   > “I want to write a blog about [Your Niche, e.g., sustainable living]. Give me 5 catchy, high-interest blog post topic ideas for beginners.”
3. Review the list and pick one topic that excites you most.

**Write it down:**
📝 *My chosen topic is:* __________________________________________

💡 *Tip:* Choose a topic you’d personally read or share — that’s a good sign it’s engaging.

---

### **STEP 2: Title & Hook Creation**

**Goal:** Craft a catchy title and an opening hook that grabs attention.

**A. Create a Catchy Title**

1. Ask AI for several title options:

   > “Give me 10 catchy, click-worthy blog post titles for the topic: [Your Chosen Topic]. Focus on power words, benefits, and numbers.”
2. Pick one title that makes you want to click instantly.

📝 *My chosen title is:* _____________________________________________

**If you already have your key points ready:**
Prompt:

> “Based on these key points, suggest 3 catchy blog titles that sound exciting and clear: [paste your key points].”

---

**B. Create the Hook (Opening Paragraph)**
Your hook should make readers curious, show you understand their problem, and promise a helpful solution.

Prompt:

> “Write a compelling, short opening paragraph for a blog post titled: [Your Chosen Title]. The hook should introduce the main problem and promise a clear solution.”

📝 *My hook is:* _________________________________________________

💡 *Tip:* Read your hook out loud. Does it make you want to keep reading? If not, ask AI to rewrite it with more emotion or urgency.

---

### **STEP 3: Outline and Structure**

**Goal:** Create a clear structure so your writing flows naturally.

**Prompt:**

> “Create a detailed outline for a blog post on the topic: [Your Chosen Topic]. Use H2 and H3 headings for structure. Include an introduction, 4 actionable main points, and a strong conclusion.”

📝 *My blog outline is:* _________________________________________

💡 *Tip:* Make sure each main point adds unique value — not just repeating the same idea in different words.

---

### **STEP 4: Drafting the Content (Section by Section)**

**Goal:** Write your blog post in manageable parts with AI’s help.

#### **A. Write the First Section**

Prompt:

> “Expand on this section, keeping the tone [Your Desired Tone, e.g., friendly and expert]: [First H2 Heading from Outline, e.g., ‘1. Start Small: The Kitchen Audit’].”

📝 *My first section is:* _______________________________________

#### **B. Write the Other Sections**

Prompt (for each section):

> “Now, elaborate on the next section: [Next H2 Heading]. Keep it concise and include practical examples.”

📝 *My 2nd section is:* _______________________________________
📝 *My 3rd section is:* _______________________________________
📝 *My 4th section is:* _______________________________________

#### **C. Write the Conclusion**

Prompt:

> “Write a concluding paragraph that summarizes the main points and includes a clear Call-to-Action (CTA), asking readers to share their thoughts or experiences in the comments.”

📝 *My conclusion paragraph is:* ________________________________________

💡 *Tip:* A good conclusion restates the key message and motivates readers to act — comment, share, or subscribe.

---

### **STEP 5: Review, Refine, and Final Polish**

**Goal:** Make your blog sound natural, engaging, and professional.

#### **A. Tone & Flow Check**

Prompt:

> “Review the full blog post and ensure the tone is consistently [Your Desired Tone, e.g., upbeat, conversational, and expert]. Make minor adjustments for flow and clarity.”

📝 *My final blog draft is:* _____________________________________________

#### **B. Read Aloud Test**

Read your post out loud. Does it sound like a real person talking to a friend?
If anything sounds robotic or unnatural, rephrase it in simpler, more conversational language.

#### **C. Final Edits**

* ✅ Check for spelling and grammar.
* ✅ Verify facts and data.
* ✅ Use formatting (bold, bullet points, subheadings) for readability.
* ✅ Ensure your intro and conclusion feel balanced.

💡 *Tip:* You can also ask AI to proofread your final version:

> “Proofread my blog post for clarity, grammar, and readability. Suggest improvements without changing my personal style.”
