#### **A. Write the First Section**

Prompt:

> “Expand on this section, keeping the tone [Your Desired Tone, e.g., friendly and expert]: [First H2 Heading as given in the Outline] using my outline

### **STEP 5: Review, Refine, and Final Polish**

**Goal:** Make your blog sound natural, engaging, and professional.

#### **A. Tone & Flow Check**

Prompt:

> “Please review the entire blog post to ensure the tone remains consistently [your desired tone, e.g., upbeat, conversational, and expert]. Make light edits for flow, clarity, and readability. The final result should sound natural, engaging, and human—not robotic or overly formal. Avoid using complex words”

📝 *My final blog draft is:* _____________________________________________

## NB: 
**To avoid your blog getting rejected:**  
> Add links to the sources you got the information or news.
> To add link in opera news hub, highlight the text you want to add link
> Then with the text highlighted-- click add link and then paste your link  

#### **B. Read Aloud Test**

Read your post out loud. Does it sound like a real person talking to a friend?
If anything sounds robotic or unnatural, rephrase it in simpler, more conversational language.
