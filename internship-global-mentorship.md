## 1. Framing & Expectations  

**How to prepare:**  

* Be clear on **why you’re doing this program**.  
* Write short answers to:  

  * *What role(s) am I targeting?*  
  * *What industry or sector?*  
  * *What’s my timeline? (immediate, 3–6 months, exploratory?)*  
* Think about what success looks like after the program (e.g., interviews, clarity, career switch).  

👉 Tip: Don’t overthink—bullet points are enough.

## 2. Resume vs CV Clarity  

**How to prepare:**  

* Understand the basic difference:  

  * **CV** → detailed, academic/professional history (longer)  
  * **Resume** → tailored, concise, role-specific (1–2 pages)  
* Reflect on:

  * Which one are you currently using?  
  * Who do you usually send it to? (employers, institutions, NGOs, etc.)  

👉 You’re not expected to be an expert—just know *what you’ve been doing so far*.

## 3. Review the Current CV (High-Level)  

**How to prepare:**  

* Bring your **current CV** (even if you think it’s bad).  
* Do a quick self-audit:  

  * What roles does it currently “sell” you for?  
  * What feels outdated, unclear, or weak?  
* Highlight (mentally or on paper):  

  * 2–3 roles or experiences you’re proud of  
  * 1–2 areas you struggle to explain  

👉 They’re not judging—this is diagnostic.

## 4. Reframing & Positioning Discussion  

This is the most important part.  

**How to prepare:**  

* Think in terms of **story**, not job titles:  

  * What problems do I solve?  
  * What am I known for at work?  
  * What skills keep showing up in my career?  
* Be honest about:  

  * Career breaks  
  * Role changes  
  * Lateral moves or stalled growth  

👉 The coach helps *reframe*—they need raw truth, not perfection.

## 5. Homework & Close (10 mins)  

**How to prepare:**  

* Expect:  

  * CV rewriting tasks  
  * Reflection questions  
  * Target role research  
* Come ready to:  

  * Ask clarifying questions  
  * Confirm deadlines  
  * Agree on next steps  

👉 Keep a notebook or notes app open.
