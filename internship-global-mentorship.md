* Framing & expectations  
* Resume vs CV clarity  
* Review the current CV (high-level)  
* Reframing & positioning discussion  
* Homework & close: 10 mins  

---

### 1. Framing & Expectations  
 
* Write short answers to:  

  * *What role(s) am I targeting?*  
  * *What industry or sector?*  
  * *What’s my timeline? (immediate, 3–6 months, exploratory?)*
 
  * What problems do I solve?  
  * What am I known for at work?  
  * What skills keep showing up in my career? 

👉 Tip: Don’t overthink—bullet points are enough.

### 2. Resume vs CV Clarity  

* Understand the basic difference between **CV** and **Resume**:  

  * **CV** → detailed, academic/professional history (longer)  
  * **Resume** → tailored, concise, role-specific (1–2 pages)  
* Reflect on:

  * Which one are you currently using?  
  * Who do you usually send it to? (employers, institutions, NGOs, etc.)   

---

### 3. Review the Current CV (High-Level)  
**Ask your self this question on every bullet point of your cv:**  
* Which part are you comfortable/ not comfortable with. Why?  
  
---

* Keep your identity clear  
* Concise, measurable and role aligned  
 
* **Problem** - What challenge, gap, or inefficiency existed? (e.g., "Manual data entry was causing 20% error rates.")  
* **Execution** - What actions, tools, or methods did you use? (e.g., "Developed an automated Python script to streamline input.")  
* **Impact** - What changed as a result? (e.g., "Reduced errors to 0% and saved 10 hours of labor weekly.")
