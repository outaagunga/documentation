## 🔑 QUICK CAREER REFRESH CHECKLIST

### 1. Story Framework (Use for CV, interviews, LinkedIn)

* **Problem / Task** – What needed fixing?
* **Action** – What I personally did (skills, decisions, tools)
* **Result / Impact** – What changed because of it? (numbers if possible)
* **Plain Explanation** – How would I explain this to a non-technical person?

---

### 2. CV Tailoring Rule

* **Mirror the job description**

  * Use the **exact keywords** and phrases from the JD
  * Apply them in:

    * Profile summary
    * Core skills section
    * Experience bullets

---

### 3. Cover Letters (Smart Use of AI)

* Use AI to create **job-specific** cover letters
* Feed AI:

  * Job description
  * Your CV
* Output should:

  * Match the role language
  * Highlight *relevant* achievements only

---

## 4. Interview Preparation (With AI — Clear & Practical)

### A. What You Practice (Exactly)

#### 1. Behavioral Questions (STAR — but tighter)

You are practicing answers to **predictable categories**, not random questions.

Common categories:

* Handling pressure or mistakes
* Conflict or difficult stakeholders
* Process improvement
* Deadlines / workload management
* Learning something new quickly

**Standard question examples:**

* “Tell me about a time you solved a problem.”
* “Describe a challenge you faced and how you handled it.”
* “Tell me about a mistake you made.”

👉 You should prepare **2–3 strong stories** that can be reused across many questions.

---

#### 2. Technical Explanations (Simple Language)

Practice explaining:

* What you do
* How a process works
* A tool you use
* A decision you made

**Test:**

> Can I explain this to a non-technical manager in 60 seconds?

If not, it’s not ready.

---

### B. How to Use AI (Concrete Prompts)

#### 1. Simulate the Interview

**Prompt:**

> “Act as a hiring manager interviewing for a **[role]**. Ask me behavioral and technical interview questions one at a time. After each answer, give feedback and ask a follow-up question.”

👉 This trains you for **pressure and follow-ups**, not just rehearsed answers.

---

#### 2. Pressure-Test Answers

After you answer, paste your response and ask:

**Prompt:**

> “Critique this answer as an interviewer. Identify weak points, missing impact, unclear areas, and suggest a sharper version.”

What AI checks:

* Is the problem clear?
* Is your role obvious?
* Is the impact specific?
* Did you avoid unnecessary detail?

---

#### 3. Reduce Rambling (This Is Key)

Take a long answer and use:

**Prompt:**

> “Reduce this answer to **60–90 seconds** without losing meaning. Remove filler, tighten structure, and keep it interview-ready.”

👉 You’re training **clarity under time pressure**.

---

### C. STAR Done Properly (Simple Structure)

Use this **compressed STAR**:

1. **Situation / Task** – 1–2 sentences
2. **Action** – 2–3 sentences (what *you* did)
3. **Result** – 1 sentence (impact or lesson)

**Bad sign:**
If Action is shorter than Situation → you’re narrating, not demonstrating.

---

### D. Technical Answers: Simple Formula

Use:

> **What it is → Why it matters → How I use it**

**Example:**

> “Excel is my main tracking tool. I use it because it allows real-time updates and audit-friendly records. I use formulas and structured tables to track stock movement and balances.”

👉 This works even for complex tools.

---

### F. How You Know You’re Ready

You’re interview-ready when:

* You answer without “uhm” and backtracking
* You finish answers naturally (not rushed, not long)
* Follow-up questions don’t throw you off

---

### 5. Identity Clarity (Personal Brand)

* Be clear on:

  * **Who I am professionally**
  * **What problems I solve**
  * **Where I add the most value**
* Ensure consistency across:

  * CV
  * LinkedIn
  * Interviews

---

### 6. Problem → Execution → Impact Rule

* Every experience must answer:

  * What problem existed?
  * What action did I take?
  * What was the outcome?

---

### 7. Final Quality Check

* **Concise** – No filler or repetition
* **Measurable** – numbers, scale, scope
* **Role-aligned** – relevant to *this* job, not all jobs

--- 

## 8. LinkedIn Execution (Clear, Practical, No Guesswork)

### A. Headline (Formula You Can Reuse)

**Format:**

> **Current / Target Role** + **Problem You Solve or Impact** + **Keywords Recruiters Search**

**Examples:**

* *Supply Chain Officer | Reducing Stock Loss & Improving Inventory Accuracy | ERP, Excel, Audits*
* *Data Analyst | Turning Raw Data into Business Decisions | Power BI, SQL, Excel*
* *Graduate Engineer | Site Supervision & Quality Control | AutoCAD, Project Reporting*

👉 Rule:
If a recruiter searches a **job title or tool**, your headline should help you appear.

---

### B. About Section (Compressed Story Framework)

Think **5 short paragraphs**, not an essay:

1. **Who you are**
   *Your role, level, or direction*
2. **What you work on**
   *Types of problems or responsibilities*
3. **How you create impact**
   *Results, improvements, efficiencies*
4. **Tools / skills you use**
   *Only relevant ones*
5. **Direction / openness**
   *What you’re targeting or open to*

**Example:**

> I’m an inventory and stores officer with experience managing stock across multiple sites.
>
> I focus on improving stock accuracy, reducing losses, and creating simple systems that work in real-world environments.
>
> In my recent role, I supported inventory audits, improved tracking processes, and helped ensure timely availability of materials.
>
> I work mainly with Excel, inventory records, reporting tools, and cross-team coordination.
>
> Currently open to roles in inventory, stores, and operations where accuracy and accountability matter.

👉 Rule:
Write like you’re explaining your work to a **smart non-expert**, not impressing peers.

---

### C. Experience Section (CV-Aligned, More Human)

**Don’t copy-paste your CV.**
Do this instead:

**Each role = 3–5 bullets**
Each bullet follows:

> **Action + Tool → Result**
> Worked in [organization type/team], responsible for [main tasks/tools], supporting [process, operations, reporting, or outcomes].

**Example:**

* Maintained daily stock records using Excel, improving stock visibility across departments
* Supported stock-taking and audit exercises, helping reduce discrepancies
* Issued materials to officers while maintaining accurate balances and documentation

👉 Difference from CV:

* CV = tight, formal, quantified
* LinkedIn = readable, narrative, still professional

---
**Profile Headline**
* e.g Data Analyst & Visualization Specialist | Turning Raw Data into Decision-Ready Insights | Power BI, Python, SQL, Excel, Dashboards
---
**Title** 
* e.g Data analysis and records support role within an NGO research and administrative environment, focusing on data cleaning, reporting, dashboard development and improving internal data workflows to support monitoring and decision-making across teams  
---

### D. Activity: What “Being Active” Actually Means

#### 1. Commenting (2–3 times per week)

**Where to comment:**

* Recruiters in your field
* Industry professionals
* Companies you’d like to work for

**How to comment (simple formula):**

> Acknowledge + Add a small insight

**Example comments:**

* “This is a useful reminder on interview preparation—especially the point about tailoring answers to the role.”
* “Interesting perspective. I’ve seen how clear stock records can really simplify audits in practice.”

👉 No “Great post 👍” — add *one sentence of thinking*.

---

#### 2. Posting (Optional, Once Every 2–3 Weeks)

You are **not trying to be a content creator**.

Post short, practical insights like:

* A lesson you learned at work
* A mistake you fixed
* A simple process that helped you

**Example post:**

> One thing I’ve learned working with inventory is that small daily updates prevent big audit problems later.
>
> Clear records save time, stress, and explanations.

👉 Insight > ego. Practical > polished.

---

## 9. Achievement Bank (Your Secret Weapon)

You need a **master list**, not just tailored outputs.

Create one document with:

* All achievements (big + small)
* Metrics, scope, scale
* Problems solved
* Tools used

Then:

* Pull from this bank to build:

  * CVs
  * Cover letters
  * Interview answers

👉 This prevents scrambling and repetition fatigue.

---

## 10. Networking Strategy (Light but Intentional)

You have preparation, but no **connection plan**.

Add:

* Weekly target:

  * 5–10 LinkedIn connection requests
* Who to connect with:

  * Recruiters in your field
  * People in roles you want
* Simple message:

  * Curious, respectful, non-begging

👉 Jobs come faster through **people**, not applications.

---

## 11. ATS & Formatting Check

Before submission, ensure:

* Simple fonts (Calibri, Arial)
* No tables for core content
* Standard headings
* Clean PDF or DOCX

👉 Even the best content fails if ATS can’t read it.

---

## 12. Salary & Value Readiness

You’re preparing to get interviews—now prep to **close**.

Add:

* Market salary range research
* Your value justification:

  * “Based on my experience doing X and delivering Y…”
* Practice:

  * Salary expectation answers
  * Negotiation calmness

👉 Confidence here signals seniority.

---

## 13. Application Tracking & Feedback Loop

Add a simple tracker:

* Role applied for
* CV version used
* Interview stage
* Feedback received

Then ask:

* What’s working?
* What’s not converting?

👉 This turns job search into a **system**, not guesswork.

---

## 14. Follow-Up Discipline

* Thank-you email after interviews
* Polite follow-up if silent after 7–10 days

👉 This alone differentiates you from 80% of candidates.

---

### 1. Framing & Expectations  
 
* Write short answers to:

  * What skills keep showing up in my career? 

👉 Tip: Don’t overthink—bullet points are enough.  

---  

### 2. Resume vs CV Clarity  

* Understand the basic difference between **CV** and **Resume**:  

  * **CV** → detailed, academic/professional history (longer)  
  * **Resume** → tailored, concise, role-specific (1–2 pages)  
* Reflect on:

  * Which one are you currently using?  
  * Who do you usually send it to? (employers, institutions, NGOs, etc.)   

---

### 3. Review the Current CV (High-Level)  
**Ask your self this question on every bullet point of your cv:**  
* Which part are you comfortable/ not comfortable with. Why?
* Mimic recruiter question on each part (e.g So what changed because of this dashboard?)
  
---

* Keep your identity clear  
* Concise, measurable and role aligned  
 
* **Problem** - What challenge, gap, or inefficiency existed? (e.g., "Manual data entry was causing 20% error rates.")  
* **Execution** - What actions, tools, or methods did you use? (e.g., "Developed an automated Python script to streamline input.")  
* **Impact** - What changed as a result? (e.g., "Reduced errors to 0% and saved 10 hours of labor weekly.")
