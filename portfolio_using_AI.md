# Building a Portfolio Website Using AI

We will build a portfolio website to showcase our work by leveraging different AI platforms. The workflow combines template inspiration, UI generation, and code development.

## Tools & Platforms

- **Dribbble or Mobbin** – for portfolio template inspiration  
- **Google Stitch** – for generating a UI design from inspiration images  
- **Microsoft Copilot** – for building the portfolio website using code  
- **Free hosting platforms** (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages) – for deploying the website  

---

## Step 1: Gather Inspiration

- Visit Dribbble (or Mobbin) and browse portfolio website templates.  
- Select a design you like.  
- Take a screenshot of the chosen design.  

---

## Step 2: Generate UI Design

- Go to Google Stitch.  
- Upload the screenshot of the portfolio design.  
- Use this prompt:  

  > “Use the image provided as inspiration to generate a portfolio website UI.”

- Review the generated UI and save a screenshot.  

---

## Step 3: Build with Microsoft Copilot

- Open Microsoft Copilot.  
- Upload the screenshot of the generated UI.  
- Use this prompt:  

  > “I want to build a portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use the image provided as inspiration and generate clean, responsive code.”

- Copy the generated code.  
- Edit or customize where necessary (add your name, projects, bio, etc.).  

---

## Step 4: Host Your Portfolio

- Choose a free hosting platform such as:  
  - Vercel  
  - Netlify  
  - GitHub Pages  
- Upload your project files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).  
- Deploy and test your live portfolio site.  

---

✅ Now your portfolio website is live, AI-assisted, and ready to showcase your work.

Would you like me to expand this into a full project checklist (with tasks you can tick off step by step), or keep it as a simple guide?

# Creating a Talking Video Using AI

Here’s a more polished version of your steps for creating a talking video using AI:

## Generate the Script

- Use ChatGPT (or another AI writing tool) to create your video content, e.g., a tutorial, presentation, or explainer.  

## Convert Text to Audio

- Use 11Labs AI to transform your script into natural-sounding speech.  

## Prepare the Visual

- **Option A:** Generate an AI image using Leonardo AI (or a similar tool).  
- **Option B:** Use a real photo of yourself if you prefer a personalized touch.  

## Create the Talking Video

- Upload your chosen image and the generated audio to HeyGen AI (or similar platforms).  
- The tool will sync the lip movements and create a realistic talking video.  

## Download and Share

- Export the final video and use it as you wish—for tutorials, social media, marketing, or training.
