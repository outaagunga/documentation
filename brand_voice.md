# Discovering a client’s brand voice

## ✅ **1. Analyze Their Existing Content**

Before your first call, scan what they’ve already published:

* **LinkedIn posts**
* **Company website**
* **Blog articles**
* **Email newsletters (if available)**
* **Their comments and replies**

Look for:

* Tone: formal, friendly, witty, inspirational?
* Sentence style: short + punchy or long + explanatory?
* Vocabulary: simple words or industry-heavy jargon?
* Emotional level: enthusiastic, neutral, confident, empathetic?

---

## ✅ **2. Ask the Right Questions on the Discovery Call**

Your goal is to extract *how they want to sound*, not just *what they do*.

Ask:

1. **How do you want your audience to feel when they read your content?**
2. **What 3 words describe your ideal voice?** (e.g., bold, educational, warm)
3. **What brands or creators do you love the tone of?**
4. **Are there voices you hate or want to avoid?**
5. **Do you prefer short-form clarity or long-form storytelling?**
6. **Do you want to sound like a person or a brand?**
7. **Is there anything you *never* want said on your behalf?**

These questions reveal everything you need.

---

## ✅ **3. Create a “Voice Snapshot” Document**

After the call, make a simple one-page profile:

* **Voice:** e.g., Conversational, confident, and slightly humorous
* **Audience:** Who you’re talking to
* **Phrases they commonly use**
* **Phrases they avoid**
* **Examples of correct vs. incorrect tone**

Send it to the client for approval—this prevents revisions later.

---

## ✅ **4. Review Their Messaging Tools**

If available, ask for:

* Brand guidelines
* Past newsletters
* Course or webinar scripts
* Sales pages
* Lead magnets

These show how they naturally communicate.

---

## ✅ **5. Write a Short Sample (Optional, but powerful)**

Offer a **100–150 word sample** in their brand voice based on notes you gathered.
This:

* Confirms you're aligned
* Builds trust
* Reduces revisions

# How to speak the **language of your audience**

# ⭐ Step 1: Know **Exactly** Who You're Talking To

You can’t speak someone’s language if you don’t know who they are.

Create a mini profile:

* **Who are they?** (job title, age, pain point)
* **What do they want?**
* **What frustrates them daily?**
* **What are they trying to avoid?**
* **What do they hope to achieve?**

When you know this, your writing will automatically shift to their style.

---

# ⭐ Step 2: Listen Before You Write

Find out *how* they already speak.

Go to:

* LinkedIn comments in your niche
* Reddit threads
* Facebook groups
* Amazon reviews for books/tools in your industry
* YouTube comment sections
* Industry Slack/Discord communities

Look for:

* The phrases they repeat
* Complaints they have
* Jargon they use
* What they *mean* even when they don’t say it clearly

A great writer is a great listener first.

---

# ⭐ Step 3: Use Their Words, Not Yours

The easiest cheat code:
👉 **Steal their vocabulary.**

If your audience says:

* “I feel stuck” — use it.
* “I’m overwhelmed with content” — use that.
* “I need clients, not likes” — use that line.

Mirroring their language makes them feel like you “get them.”

---

# ⭐ Step 4: Match Tone and Energy

Your tone should match *how* they want to be spoken to.

Examples:

**If they’re busy professionals:**

* Be clear, concise, direct.

**If they’re creators or founders:**

* Be energetic, optimistic, practical.

**If they’re technical people:**

* Be precise, logical, jargon-friendly.

**If they’re beginners:**

* Be friendly, simple, encouraging.

---

# ⭐ Step 5: Speak to Emotions, Not Just Logic

Every audience has an emotional reason behind their wants.

Example:

* Marketers don’t want “strategy”
  → they want **predictable results**
* Business owners don't want “content”
  → they want **visibility and revenue**
* Job seekers don’t want “resume tips”
  → they want **confidence and opportunity**

Speak to *what they feel*, not just what they say.

---

# ⭐ Step 6: Remove Anything That Doesn’t Sound Like Them

Ask yourself:

* Would they say it this way?
* Would they understand this immediately?
* Would they care about this point?

If the answer is “no,” cut it.

---

# ⭐ Step 7: Test and Learn

Once you start publishing for a specific audience, pay attention to:

* Which posts get strong comments (means language landed)
* Which posts get saved/shared (means value landed)
* Which posts get ignored (wrong tone or topic)

Your audience will teach you how to speak to them—if you watch closely.
