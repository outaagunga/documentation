✅ This structure ensures learners move from **basic syntax → advanced features → real-world use** without missing anything.

Would you like me to now **expand this into a full lesson script with examples** for each module (like a teacher’s guide + student exercises), or just keep it as an outline?

Perfect 👍 Let’s expand **Module 1** into a **full lesson script**. I’ll structure it like a teacher’s guide, with explanations, examples, and exercises for learners.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 1 – Introduction to Markdown**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

1. Explain what Markdown is and why it’s useful.
2. Identify different tools/editors that support Markdown.
3. Create and save a basic Markdown file.
4. Understand how Markdown is rendered into formatted text.

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a **lightweight markup language**.
* Created by **John Gruber** in 2004.
* Purpose: Make writing formatted text easy using **plain text**.

👉 Think of Markdown as **a way to add formatting (like bold, headings, lists) to text without using menus or complicated tools**.

---

#### 2. Why Use Markdown?

* **Simplicity**: You only need a text editor.
* **Portability**: Files are just plain text (`.md`), so they work everywhere.
* **Widespread Use**:

  * GitHub READMEs
  * Documentation (software, APIs, research papers)
  * Blogs and websites
  * Note-taking (Obsidian, Notion)

💡 Example: A paragraph in Markdown is plain text, but when rendered it looks like a web page.

```markdown
Markdown makes writing simple.

You can add *italic*, **bold**, or even [links](http://example.com).
```

---

#### 3. Markdown Editors & Tools

* **Basic**: Notepad, TextEdit (any text editor works).
* **Advanced**:

  * **VS Code** (with Markdown preview extensions)
  * **Typora** (live preview)
  * **Obsidian** (knowledge management)
  * **Dillinger.io** (online editor)
  * **GitHub** (built-in support for `.md` files)

---

#### 4. File Structure and Rendering

* Save Markdown files with `.md` or `.markdown` extension.
* Example filenames: `notes.md`, `README.md`.
* To preview formatted text:

  * In VS Code: `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Preview).
  * On GitHub: Upload the file and view.
  * In Typora/Obsidian: Auto-preview.

---

### 🖼 Example Demonstration

Raw Markdown (`hello.md`):

```markdown
# My First Markdown File

Hello! This is my first Markdown document.  
I can write text normally.

Here are some things I like:
- Reading
- Coding
- Coffee

Visit [Google](http://google.com).
```

## Rendered Output:

# My First Markdown File

Hello! This is my first Markdown document.
I can write text normally.

Here are some things I like:

* Reading
* Coding
* Coffee

Visit [Google](http://google.com).

---

### 🎓 Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Create Your First Markdown File**

1. Open a text editor (VS Code recommended).
2. Create a new file called `introduction.md`.
3. Write the following:

   * A heading with your name.
   * A paragraph introducing yourself.
   * A bullet list of your three favorite activities.
   * A link to your favorite website.

**Exercise 2: Explore Markdown Tools**

* Try editing your file in two different environments:

  * One plain text editor (like Notepad).
  * One Markdown editor with preview (like VS Code or Typora).
* Notice the difference between raw text and rendered output.

**Exercise 3 (Challenge): Publish on GitHub**

1. Create a GitHub account (if not already).
2. Create a repository and add `README.md`.
3. Write a short bio in Markdown.
4. View it in your GitHub repo.

---

### ✅ Summary

* Markdown = plain text + formatting.
* Uses `.md` files.
* Tools like VS Code, Obsidian, and GitHub help preview it.
* Great for docs, notes, and web publishing.

---

Would you like me to now **continue with Module 2 (Text Formatting Basics)** in the same script style (lesson + examples + exercises)?


Great 👍 Let’s continue with **Module 2** in the same full **lesson script format**.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 2 – Text Formatting Basics**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

1. Create headings of different levels.
2. Format text using bold, italic, and strikethrough.
3. Write paragraphs and control line breaks.
4. Use blockquotes to highlight important text.
5. Write inline code and fenced code blocks.

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Headings

Headings are created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` signs determines the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4  
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6  
```

👉 Example Output:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

💡 **Tip**: Always keep heading hierarchy logical (don’t jump from `#` to `####` suddenly).

---

#### 2. Paragraphs and Line Breaks

* Paragraphs are just blocks of text separated by a **blank line**.
* To force a line break without starting a new paragraph, end the line with **two spaces**.

```markdown
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.  
This is still part of the second paragraph (line break).
```

---

#### 3. Bold, Italic, Strikethrough

* **Italic**: `*text*` or `_text_`
* **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
* **Bold + Italic**: `***text***`
* **Strikethrough**: `~~text~~`

👉 Example:

```markdown
This is *italic*, this is **bold**,  
this is ***bold and italic***,  
and this is ~~strikethrough~~.
```

Rendered:
This is *italic*, this is **bold**,
this is ***bold and italic***,
and this is ~~strikethrough~~.

---

#### 4. Blockquotes

Blockquotes highlight quotes or important notes using `>` at the start of a line.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.  
> It can span multiple lines.  

>> Nested blockquote (double arrow).
```

👉 Example Output:

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

> > Nested blockquote (double arrow).

---

#### 5. Inline Code and Code Blocks

* **Inline code** uses backticks: `` `code` ``
* **Code blocks** use triple backticks:

````markdown
Here’s some inline code: `print("Hello World")`

```python
# This is a Python code block
print("Hello World")
````

````

👉 Example Output:  

Here’s some inline code: `print("Hello World")`  

```python
# This is a Python code block
print("Hello World")
````

---

### 🖼 Demonstration

Raw Markdown:

````markdown
# My Formatting Practice

Hello, my name is **Jane Doe**.  
I like *reading*, *coding*, and *traveling*.  

Here’s a quick quote:  
> “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”  

Now some code:  
`x = 5 + 10`

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
````

````

Rendered Output:

* Paragraphs: blank line separates, `␣␣` for line break
* Formatting: *italic*, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~
* Blockquotes: `>`
* Code: `` `inline` `` and `fenced blocks`

---

👉 Next up in **Module 3**, we’ll cover **Lists** (unordered, ordered, nested, and checklists).

Do you want me to continue with **Module 3** in the same teacher’s guide style, or should I make Module 2 more **interactive** (like adding “live challenges” to solve as the lesson goes)?
Alright 🚀 Let’s move to **Module 3 – Lists** in the same **teacher’s guide + examples + exercises** format.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 3 – Lists**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

1. Create unordered lists using different symbols.
2. Create ordered (numbered) lists.
3. Nest lists (mix ordered and unordered).
4. Create task lists (checkboxes).

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Unordered Lists

* Unordered lists use **hyphen (`-`)**, **plus (`+`)**, or **asterisk (`*`)**.
* All three work the same way.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

👉 Output:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

---

#### 2. Ordered Lists

* Ordered lists use **numbers followed by a period**.
* Numbers don’t need to be sequential (Markdown auto-fixes).

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

👉 Output:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

💡 Even if you write:

```markdown
1. First
1. Second
1. Third
```

It will still render as:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

---

#### 3. Nested Lists

* Indent **2 or 4 spaces** (depending on editor) to nest lists.
* You can mix unordered and ordered.

```markdown
1. Fruits
   - Apple
   - Banana
   - Mango
2. Vegetables
   - Carrot
   - Broccoli
   - Spinach
```

👉 Output:

1. Fruits

   * Apple
   * Banana
   * Mango
2. Vegetables

   * Carrot
   * Broccoli
   * Spinach

---

#### 4. Task Lists (Checkboxes)

* GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports checkboxes.
* Syntax: `- [ ]` for unchecked, `- [x]` for checked.

```markdown
- [x] Learn Markdown
- [ ] Practice exercises
- [ ] Build a project
```

👉 Output:

* [x] Learn Markdown
* [ ] Practice exercises
* [ ] Build a project

---

### 🖼 Demonstration

1. Create inline and reference-style links.
2. Add images with alt text and optional titles.
3. Create clickable images (images as links).
4. Use automatic links (URLs in angle brackets).

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Inline Links

Inline links are written as:

```markdown
[Link Text](URL)
```

👉 Example:

```markdown
Visit [Google](http://google.com).
```

Rendered:
Visit [Google](http://google.com).

---

#### 2. Reference-Style Links

Useful when the same link is used multiple times.

[google]: http://google.com
```

👉 Output:
This is a [search engine][google].

[google]: http://google.com

---

#### 3. Automatic Links

* Wrap a URL in `< >` and it becomes a clickable link.

```markdown
<http://example.com>
```

👉 Output:
[http://example.com](http://example.com)

---

#### 4. Images

* Images use similar syntax as links, but with an exclamation mark `!`.

```markdown
![Alt text](image_url)
```

👉 Example:

```markdown
![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
```

Output:
![Sample Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

---

#### 5. Image with Title

You can add a title (appears on hover).

```markdown
![Alt text](https://via.placeholder.com/150 "This is a sample image")
```

---

#### 6. Images as Links (Clickable Images)

Combine image syntax inside link syntax.

```markdown
[![Alt text](https://via.placeholder.com/100)](http://example.com)
```

👉 Next up in **Module 5**, we’ll learn **Tables** (basic table structure, text alignment, and formatting inside tables).

Do you want me to continue straight into **Module 5 – Tables**, or pause here so you can practice the links/images exercises first?
Great 👍 Let’s dive into **Module 5 – Tables**. I’ll keep the same **teacher’s guide style with explanations, examples, and exercises**.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 5 – Tables**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners should be able to:

1. Create basic tables in Markdown.
2. Align text inside table columns.
3. Add formatting (bold, italic, links) inside tables.
4. Build more complex tables (wide tables, multi-line content).

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Basic Table Structure

Tables use **pipes (`|`)** to separate columns and **hyphens (`-`)** to separate headers from content.

```markdown
| Name     | Age | City     |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Alice    | 25  | Nairobi  |
| Bob      | 30  | Kisumu   |
| Charlie  | 22  | Mombasa  |
```

👉 Output:

| Name    | Age | City    |
| ------- | --- | ------- |
| Alice   | 25  | Nairobi |
| Bob     | 30  | Kisumu  |
| Charlie | 22  | Mombasa |

---

#### 2. Text Alignment in Tables

You can align columns using colons (`:`):

* `:---` = left aligned
* `:---:` = center aligned
* `---:` = right aligned

```markdown
| Name     | Age | City     |
|:---------|:---:|---------:|
| Alice    | 25  | Nairobi  |
| Bob      | 30  | Kisumu   |
| Charlie  | 22  | Mombasa  |
```

👉 Output:

| Name    | Age |    City |
| :------ | :-: | ------: |
| Alice   |  25 | Nairobi |
| Bob     |  30 |  Kisumu |
| Charlie |  22 | Mombasa |

---

#### 3. Formatting Inside Tables

You can use **bold**, *italic*, links, or even inline code inside tables.

```markdown
| Language | Creator     | Notes                 |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **Python** | Guido van Rossum | Great for *data science* |
| **JavaScript** | Brendan Eich | Runs in the **browser** |
| **C** | Dennis Ritchie | `printf("Hello")` |
```

👉 Output:

| Language       | Creator          | Notes                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Python**     | Guido van Rossum | Great for *data science* |
| **JavaScript** | Brendan Eich     | Runs in the **browser**  |
| **C**          | Dennis Ritchie   | `printf("Hello")`        |

---

#### 4. Complex / Wide Tables

Tables can include long text and multiple columns.

```markdown
| Task            | Description                           | Status   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Write Outline   | Create module structure for Markdown  | ✅ Done  |

---

#### 2. Fenced Code Blocks

* Use **triple backticks (```)** or **triple tildes (~~~)** for code blocks.
* Keeps formatting for multiple lines of code.

```markdown
```

This is a code block.
Line 2 stays aligned.

```
```

👉 Output:

```
This is a code block.
Line 2 stays aligned.
```

---

#### 3. Syntax Highlighting

* Add the programming language name right after the opening backticks.
* Many Markdown processors (like GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter) highlight accordingly.

````markdown
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
````

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

👉 Output:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
```

---

#### 4. Escaping Markdown Characters

Sometimes you want to show Markdown symbols (`*`, `_`, `#`) without formatting.
Use a **backslash (`\`)** before the symbol.

```markdown
\*This is not italic\*
```

👉 Output:
*This is not italic*

---

### 🖼 Demonstration

Raw Markdown:

```markdown
# Code and Syntax Highlighting Demo

👉 Up next in **Module 9**, we’ll tackle **Tables** (creating tables, aligning text, mixing with formatting).

Would you like me to **continue straight into Module 9** (Tables), or pause here for you to try some link/image exercises first?

Perfect 👍 Let’s continue with **Module 9 – Tables**.
This is an important skill since tables make data more readable inside Markdown.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 9 – Tables**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1. Create basic tables in Markdown.
2. Align text inside table cells.
3. Format text inside tables (bold, italics, links, images).
4. Build complex tables with multi-line content.

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Basic Tables

* Use pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`).
* Minimum format:

```markdown
| Name  | Age | City     |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Alice | 24  | Nairobi  |
| Bob   | 30  | Mombasa  |
```

👉 Output:

| Name  | Age | City    |
| ----- | --- | ------- |
| Alice | 24  | Nairobi |
| Bob   | 30  | Mombasa |

---

#### 2. Alignment

* Use colons (`:`) in the header separator line:

  * `:---` → Left aligned
  * `:---:` → Center aligned
  * `---:` → Right aligned

```markdown
| Item      | Price | Quantity |
|:----------|:-----:|---------:|
| Apple     |  100  |        2 |
| Banana    |   50  |       10 |
| Pineapple |  150  |        1 |
```

👉 Output:

| Item      | Price | Quantity |
| :-------- | :---: | -------: |
| Apple     |  100  |        2 |
| Banana    |   50  |       10 |
| Pineapple |  150  |        1 |

---

#### 3. Formatting Inside Tables

* Tables accept **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, links, and even images.

```markdown
| Language | Description                | Logo |
|----------|----------------------------|------|
| **Python** | Popular for *data science* | ![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png) |
| JavaScript | Web development `frontend` | ![JS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png) |
```

👉 Output:

| Language   | Description                | Logo                                                                           |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Python** | Popular for *data science* | ![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)       |
| JavaScript | Web development `frontend` | ![JS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/JavaScript-logo.png) |

---

#### 4. Complex Tables (Multi-line Content)

* Markdown doesn’t support row/column span natively.
* But you can:

  * Write longer text inside a cell.
  * Use HTML `<table>` if you need advanced layouts.

```markdown
| Task        | Details                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Assignment  | Submit the report by **Friday**.         |
| Notes       | 1. Use clear headings. <br> 2. Add charts. |
```

👉 Output:

| Task       | Details                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Assignment | Submit the report by **Friday**.           |
| Notes      | 1. Use clear headings. <br> 2. Add charts. |

---

### 🖼 Demonstration

Raw Markdown:

👉 Next up in **Module 10**, we’ll cover **Integrating HTML in Markdown** (mixing Markdown with HTML tags for more control).

Do you want me to continue directly into **Module 10**, or stop here so you can practice building tables first?

Perfect 🚀 We’ve reached the final section: **Module 10 – Integrating HTML in Markdown**.
This will show learners how to go beyond Markdown’s limits using raw HTML.

---

# 📘 Lesson Script: Markdown Formatting

## **Module 10 – Integrating HTML in Markdown**

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1. Understand when and why to use HTML inside Markdown.
2. Insert HTML tags for advanced formatting.
3. Mix Markdown and HTML seamlessly.
4. Create styled content (colors, custom alignment, etc.).
5. Embed videos, iframes, and forms.

---

### 📝 Lesson Content

#### 1. Why Use HTML in Markdown?

* Markdown is **simple**, but limited.
* HTML lets you:

  * Control **alignment** (center text, right-align).
  * Add **colors and styles**.
  * Embed **media** (YouTube, audio, forms).
  * Create **layouts** not possible in pure Markdown.

---

#### 2. Basic HTML Tags in Markdown

Markdown supports raw HTML inline.

```markdown
<p style="color:blue;">This is blue text.</p>

<strong>This is bold with HTML</strong>
<em>This is italic with HTML</em>
```

👉 Output:

<p style="color:blue;">This is blue text.</p>  
<strong>This is bold with HTML</strong>  
<em>This is italic with HTML</em>  

---

#### 3. Text Alignment and Styling

```markdown
<p align="center">This text is centered.</p>
<p align="right" style="color:red;">Right-aligned red text.</p>
```

👉 Output:

<p align="center">This text is centered.</p>  
<p align="right" style="color:red;">Right-aligned red text.</p>  

---

#### 4. HTML Tables (Advanced)

* Use when Markdown tables aren’t enough.

```markdown
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Language</th>
    <th>Use Case</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>Data Science</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>Web Design</td>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Language</th>
    <th>Use Case</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Python</td>
    <td>Data Science</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML</td>
    <td>Web Design</td>
  </tr>
</table>  

---

#### 5. Embedding Media

* Markdown doesn’t support video/audio natively → HTML solves this.

**YouTube Video Embed:**

```markdown
<iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

👉 Output (on supported platforms):
📺 Embedded YouTube video.

**Audio Embed:**

```markdown
<audio controls>
  <source src="sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
```

👉 Output (on supported platforms):
🎵 Embedded audio player.

---

#### 6. Mixing HTML and Markdown

You can combine both:

```markdown
<p align="center">
  Here’s a **Markdown bold text** inside HTML!
</p>
```

👉 Output:

<p align="center">  
  Here’s a **Markdown bold text** inside HTML!  
</p>  

---
