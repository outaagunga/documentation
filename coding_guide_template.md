Excellent idea — a **“Coding Journey Guide Template”** gives you structure, reflection, and direction as you grow in coding (especially when using AI).

Here’s a clean, reusable template you can fill in for **any coding project, tutorial, or challenge** — from beginner scripts to full-stack apps.

---

## 🧭 **Coding Journey Guide Template**

### 1. 🧠 Project Overview

* **Project Name:**
* **Main Goal / Problem to Solve:**
* **Tech Stack (Languages, Frameworks, Tools):**
* **Expected Outcome (What success looks like):**

---

### 2. 🎯 Learning Objectives

* What **new concept(s)** or **skill(s)** do I want to learn or practice?
  (e.g., APIs, Django models, data visualization, React hooks, etc.)
* Why does this matter for my long-term goals?
* What level am I aiming for? (Understand / Apply / Master)

---

### 3. ⚙️ Project Setup

* **Environment:** (VS Code, Colab, Replit, Jupyter, etc.)
* **Libraries / Dependencies to Install:**
* **Repository / Folder structure plan:**
* **Version Control:** (GitHub repo link, branches plan)

---

### 4. 💬 AI Collaboration Plan

* **AI Role:** (e.g., code explainer, debugger, refactorer, documentation helper)
* **Prompt Style to Use:**
  (e.g., “Explain like I’m a beginner”, “Act as a senior Python developer”, etc.)
* **How I’ll verify AI output:**
  (Manual testing, reading docs, stackoverflow cross-check, etc.)

### 5. 🧩 Core Features or Tasks

| # | Feature / Task | Description | Status               |
| - | -------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1 |                |             | [ ] To Do / [x] Done |
| 2 |                |             | [ ] To Do / [x] Done |

---

### 6. 🧪 Testing & Debugging Plan

* **Type of Tests:** (manual / unit tests / integration tests)
* **Known Bugs / Issues:**
* **AI Debug Prompts to Use:**
  (e.g., “Explain why this function breaks with edge case input.”)

---

### 7. 📘 Documentation

* **Code Comments:** How often and what format?
* **README Summary:** (1-sentence purpose, setup steps, usage)
* **Version Notes / Changelog:**

---

### 8. 🚀 Deployment / Output

* **Where to deploy or run:** (Localhost, cloud, GitHub Pages, Render, etc.)
* **How users will interact with it:**
* **Performance / Security considerations:**

---

### 9. 🪞 Reflection & Lessons Learned

* What went well?
* What was frustrating — and how did I overcome it?
* What will I do differently next time?
* One key takeaway or concept that “clicked”:

---

### 10. 📈 Next Steps

* What’s the next feature or project to build on this?
* What new skills do I need to learn next?
* Resources / tutorials / mentors to follow up with:

Would you like me to make this template **AI-interactive** — for example, so you can paste it into ChatGPT and it automatically asks you questions step-by-step as you fill it in?
