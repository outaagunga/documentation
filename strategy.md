# ✅ **HTF Wick Strategy — Step-by-Step Trading Checklist (Beginner Version)**  


# **📌 STEP 1 — Determine Trend/Bias (Higher Timeframe)**  

### **On the 4H & Daily chart:**  

* ☐ Is price **below** the 50 EMA AND the EMA sloping down?  
  → **Bias = SELL only**  
* ☐ Is price **above** the 50 EMA AND the EMA sloping up?  
  → **Bias = BUY only**  

✔ Only trade in ONE direction per session  
✔ NO countertrend trades  


# **📌 STEP 2 — Wait for a New 4H Candle to Open**  

4H candles start at:  
**02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00** (broker time varies)  

* ☐ Has a new 4H candle opened?  

If **SELL BIAS** → expect price to push UP first (form top wick)  
If **BUY BIAS** → expect price to push DOWN first (form bottom wick)  

**Do NOT enter before the manipulation/wick forms.**  


# **📌 STEP 3 — Mark Your Setup Area (Fair Value Gaps)**  

Switch to **5-minute or 15-minute chart**:  

* ☐ Mark the most recent unmitigated FVG located near previous swing high/low  

If **SELLING:**  

* ☐ Mark the nearest FVG *above* current price  

If **BUYING:**  

* ☐ Mark the nearest FVG *below* current price  

**Only trade if price taps into that FVG.**  


# **📌 STEP 4 — Wait for Price to Tap the FVG**  

* ☐ Has price reached the FVG zone?  
  → If *no*, **NO trade**  

Once price taps:  

* For **SELL**: price must tap UP into the FVG  
* For **BUY**: price must tap DOWN into the FVG  

This is the wick of the HTF candle.  


# **📌 STEP 5 — Look for Simple LTF Confirmation (1M–3M chart)**  

Switch to 1M–3M:  

### **SELL Confirmation Checklist**  

* ☐ Price entered FVG  
* ☐ Price rejected and moved down  
* ☐ A recent **structure low is broken**  

### **BUY Confirmation Checklist**  

* ☐ Price entered FVG  
* ☐ Price rejected and moved up  
* ☐ A recent **structure high is broken**  

If this does NOT happen → **NO trade**.  


# **📌 STEP 6 — Entry & Stop Loss**  

### **SELL Entry**  

* ☐ Enter after pullback following BOS (break of structure)  
* ☐ Stop loss above the wick that tapped the FVG  

### **BUY Entry**  

* ☐ Enter after pullback following BOS  
* ☐ Stop loss below the wick that tapped the FVG  

Stops should be clean and small.  


# **📌 STEP 7 — Take Profit Target**  

Choose ONE:  

* ☐ Previous swing low/high (safest)  
* ☐ 2R–3R (balanced and reliable)  
* ☐ 4H candle completion (advanced / higher reward)  


# **📌 STEP 8 — Post-Trade Review**  

After trade closes, evaluate:  

* ☐ Did I follow the bias rules?  
* ☐ Did I wait for a 4H candle?  
* ☐ Did I ONLY trade after tapping the FVG?  
* ☐ Did I wait for confirmation?  
* ☐ Did I avoid impulsive entries?  


# ⭐ Summary: The Only Things You Need  

* **Trend from 4H & Daily (50 EMA)**  
* **New 4H candle opening**  
* **Clear 5m–15m FVG**  
* **LTF confirmation (BOS)**  
* **Simple SL + 2R–3R TP**  

This is the simplest and safest way for beginners to trade the HTF wick concept.

## ✅ Choppy Market Range-Bounce Strategy — Step-by-Step Checklist (Beginner Version)  

### 📌 STEP 1 — Identify the Range (H1/H4)  
* ☐ Mark clear Support zone  
* ☐ Mark clear Resistance zone  
* ☐ Range width must be obvious and wide enough (not less than 40 pips)  

### 📌 STEP 2 — Check Market Condition  
* ☐ Is the 200 EMA flat?
* ☐ No major trend on Daily timeframe (price not making strong higher highs/lower lows)  
* ☐ Price has touched Support/Resistance atleast 2 times?  
* ☐ Is price bouncing between Support/Resistance?  
* If “yes” → proceed.  
* If “no” → skip.  

### 📌 STEP 3 — Prepare for Trade at the Edges  
BUY Setup  
* ☐ Wait for price to touch Support  
* ☐ Confirm RSI oversold (below 30)  
* ☐ Look for bullish rejection candle  
* ☐ Rejection candle pattern is clear (pin bar, engulfing, hammer/star)

SELL Setup  
* ☐ Wait for price to touch Resistance  
* ☐ Confirm RSI overbought (above 70)  
* ☐ Look for bearish rejection candle
* ☐ Rejection candle pattern is clear (pin bar, engulfing, hammer/star)  

### 📌 STEP 4 — Entry  
* ☐ Enter **only after** the rejection candle closes  
* ☐ No entries mid-range  
* ☐ No entries early  

### 📌 STEP 5 — Stop Loss  
* ☐ SL placed outside the Support/Resistance zone  
* ☐ Added 5–10 pip safety padding  

### 📌 STEP 6 — Take Profit  
Choose one:  
* ☐ TP1: Mid-range (quick, safe)  
* ☐ TP2: Opposite zone (full move)  

### 📌 STEP 7 — Risk Rules  
* ☐ Risk max 1% per trade  
* ☐ No revenge trades  
* ☐ No trading during major news releases  

### 📌 STEP 8 — Review After the Trade  
* ☐ Did I trade only at the edges?

* ☐ Did I avoid trading in the middle?  
* ☐ Did I follow SL/TP rules?

---

### STEP 3: Check RSI Confirmation

## Quick Reference: Daily Candle Entry Strategy (Beginner-Friendly)

### SETUP (Do Once)

* **Timeframe**: Daily chart to identify zones, drop to 5-min or 15-min for entries
* **Pairs / Markets**: Any liquid market (Forex, indices, crypto)
* **Indicators**: None required (price-action based), optional small EMA for structure reference

---

### STEP 1: Mark Daily Candle Close

* Wait for the **previous daily candle to fully close**
* Draw a horizontal line at the **closing price**
* This will be your **key reference zone**

---

### STEP 2: Determine Bias

* **Bullish daily close** → look to **buy below the close**
* **Bearish daily close** → look to **sell above the close**
* Do not trade against the daily bias

---

### STEP 3: Drop to Lower Timeframe

* Use **5-minute or 15-minute charts**
* Watch how price behaves around the daily close zone

---

### STEP 4: Wait for Entry Signal

* **For BUY below bullish close**:

  * Price dips below daily close line
  * Look for small **rejection candles**, **wicks**, or minor **structure shift**
* **For SELL above bearish close**:

  * Price rises above daily close line
  * Look for small **rejection candles**, **wicks**, or minor **structure shift**
* Optional: Enter at **imbalance / liquidity grab** if visible

---

### STEP 5: Enter Trade

* Enter when the lower timeframe shows **confirmation of reversal**
* Risk **1–2% of account per trade**

---

### STEP 6: Set Stop Loss Immediately

* Place stop loss **just beyond the wick or structure extreme**
* Typically **5–10 pips for Forex**, adjust for volatility

---

### STEP 7: Set Take Profit

* Target **1:2 or 1:3 risk-reward ratio**
* Optionally use next **minor swing high/low** on lower timeframe as TP

---

### STEP 8: Walk Away

* Mark your levels and **don’t over-monitor**
* Let price move
* Adjust TP if market structure changes, but do not chase trades

---

This method simplifies daily candle entries, uses **low-risk zones**, and gives beginners a **structured way to trade without relying on complex indicators**.
