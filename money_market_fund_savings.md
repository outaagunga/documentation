## 🧭 **Phase 1: Preparation and Research**

### 1️⃣ Define Your Savings Goal

MMFs are best for **short-term financial goals (1–5 years)** or **emergency funds**.
Examples:

* Emergency fund (6-12months)  
* House deposit (2- 4yrs)  
* Funding a car (or any other thing you may like)  

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> Help me define a clear savings goal for my MMF. I earn KSh 150,000 monthly, have KSh 50,000 in expenses, and want to buy a car in 3 years budgeted at KSh 1.2 million. Calculate my required monthly contribution.  


> I currently have KSh 300,000 for my emergency fund. I want to save 6 months of living expenses. My monthly expenses are KSh 85,000. Give me a target monthly contribution and the total time needed to reach the full goalns?

### 2️⃣ Research and Compare MMF Providers (Due Diligence)

> ⚠️ Crucial Safety Note: MMFs are not insured like bank deposits. While low-risk, always choose funds registered and regulated by your country's financial authority (e.g., the Capital Markets Authority in Kenya).  

| Metric                   | What It Means                      | What to Look For                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Yield/Return Rate**    | The interest earned (7-Day Yield). | Higher is better, but ensure stability. |
| **Fees (Expense Ratio)** | Cost of managing the fund.         | Lower = more returns for you.           |
| **Liquidity**            | How fast you can withdraw funds.   | 1–3 business days is ideal.             |
| **Minimum Investment**   | The least you can start with.      | Go for affordable entry options.        |

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> Create a comparison table for the top three regulated money market funds in Kenya (or your country). Include their current 7-Day Net Yield, Expense Ratio, and withdrawal period in the table.

> Analyze and simplify the fund prospectus for the [Provider Name] MMF. List the top 5 assets they hold and any specific risks mentioned.

## 💼 **Phase 2: Setting Up Your MMF Investment**

### 3️⃣ Open an Investment Account

Opening an MMF is usually done online or via a mobile app. The fund manager will guide you through the KYC (Know Your Customer) process.  


**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> I'm preparing to open an MMF account with [Provider Name]. I live in [Your City]. Generate a complete, itemized checklist of the required documents, emphasizing any digital or notarized requirements.  

> “Help me draft a polite email to inquire about opening a money market fund account.”

### 4️⃣ Fund Your Account (Initial Investment)

Transfer your initial deposit to the MMF of your choice. The minimum is often low (e.g., KSh 1,000 - KSh 5,000), making MMFs highly accessible. Your earnings are typically calculated daily and compounded monthly.  

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> I have KSh 75,000 I want to invest. If the MMF yield is 11.5% and I start a standing order of KSh 5,000 monthly, what is the projected balance after 18 months, assuming monthly compounding?  

> Create a simple budget adjustment plan to free up an extra KSh 2,500 monthly for my MMF, focusing on non-essential spending categories like dining out and subscriptions.  

---

### 5️⃣ Set Up a Consistent Savings Plan  

Automation is the single most powerful tool for wealth building. Set a recurring, automated transfer from your bank to your MMF immediately after your payday. This is paying yourself first  

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> Generate a 12-month savings calendar. My payday is the 25th of every month. I want to automate a KSh 7,500 MMF transfer on the 26th. The calendar should include the deposit date, amount, and running total.  

> Explain the concept of **Dollar-Cost Averaging** as it applies to consistent monthly deposits into a stable MMF, using a simple analogy.  

---

## 📈 **Phase 3: Maximizing Your Earnings**

### 6️⃣ Monitor and Reinvest Your Earnings  

Check your MMF's Net Yield quarterly. If a competitor offers a significantly better, stable yield, consider switching. Always ensure your fund is set to reinvest all interest earned—this is how you maximize compounding.  

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> Create a simple spreadsheet template with columns for: Date, Fund Name, Yield, Investment Balance, and Monthly Return. Include a formula to calculate the return based on the yield and balance.  

> Compare the total growth difference over 5 years between reinvesting MMF interest vs. withdrawing it, based on an initial KSh 100,000 investment and a steady 10% annual yield.
