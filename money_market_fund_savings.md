# 💰 AI-Powered Follow-Along Guide: Saving & Earning with a Money Market Fund (MMF)

---

## 🧭 **Phase 1: Preparation and Research**

### 1️⃣ Define Your Savings Goal

MMFs are best for **short-term financial goals (1–5 years)** or **emergency funds**.
Examples:

* Saving for a house deposit
* Building an emergency fund
* Funding a vacation or a wedding

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Help me define my savings goal for a money market fund based on my income, expenses, and timeline.”
> “Given that I want to save KSh 200,000 in 2 years, what target should I set for monthly contributions?”

### 2️⃣ Research and Compare MMF Providers (Due Diligence)

Before you invest, compare different MMF providers. Look for:

| Metric                   | What It Means                      | What to Look For                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Yield/Return Rate**    | The interest earned (7-Day Yield). | Higher is better, but ensure stability. |
| **Fees (Expense Ratio)** | Cost of managing the fund.         | Lower = more returns for you.           |
| **Liquidity**            | How fast you can withdraw funds.   | 1–3 business days is ideal.             |
| **Minimum Investment**   | The least you can start with.      | Go for affordable entry options.        |

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “List top-rated money market funds in Kenya (or my country) with current yields, fees, and withdrawal terms.”
> “Compare CIC, Sanlam, and Britam money market funds — which offers the best balance of yield and liquidity?”

## 💼 **Phase 2: Setting Up Your MMF Investment**

### 3️⃣ Open an Investment Account

You can open an MMF account with a **bank**, **broker**, or **mutual fund company**.

You’ll usually need:

* National ID or passport
* Proof of address (e.g., utility bill)
* Bank details

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Generate a checklist of all documents I need to open a money market fund account with [provider name].”
> “Help me draft a polite email to inquire about opening a money market fund account.”

---

### 4️⃣ Fund Your Account (Initial Investment)

Transfer your first deposit to your MMF account (meet the provider’s minimum).
Start small — you can always add more later.

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Given my income and expenses, how much should I invest initially in an MMF without affecting my budget?”
> “Create a safe first-month investment plan for me if I can spare KSh 10,000.”

---

### 5️⃣ Start Earning Daily Interest

Once invested, your money earns daily interest through low-risk assets like Treasury Bills and Commercial Papers.
Interest compounds monthly — meaning **you earn returns on your previous returns**.

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Explain how my daily interest will grow in a money market fund if I invest KSh 50,000 at 11% annual yield.”
> “Show me a table of projected earnings over 12 months with monthly compounding.”

---

## 📈 **Phase 3: Maximizing Your Earnings**

### 6️⃣ Set Up a Consistent Savings Plan (Automate)

Automate deposits from your bank (weekly or monthly). This builds discipline and applies **Dollar-Cost Averaging** — smoothing market fluctuations.

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Create a monthly savings automation plan for my MMF with reminders and goals.”
> “Design a budget that automatically allocates 10% of my income to my MMF.”

---

### 7️⃣ Monitor Performance and Fees

Check your MMF’s published yield every few months. Ensure your fund remains competitive and fees stay low.

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Summarize the current yield performance of Kenyan MMFs this month.”
> “Create a spreadsheet tracker to monitor my MMF balance, yield rate, and monthly returns.”

---

### 8️⃣ Reinvest Your Earnings

Always reinvest your interest back into the fund to compound your returns faster.

**💬 AI Prompt Example:**

> “Explain how much faster my MMF will grow if I reinvest all earnings for 3 years.”
> “Generate a comparison chart between withdrawing vs. reinvesting my MMF interest.”
