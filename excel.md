Would you like me to **create a step-by-step build guide (click-by-click)** for assembling this exact dashboard in Excel, so you can replicate it easily?

Excellent 🚀 Let’s build the **Capstone HR Dashboard step by step (click-by-click)** using your Employee dataset.

We’ll follow the layout I designed earlier.

---

# **Step-by-Step Build Guide: HR Dashboard**

---

## **Step 1: Prepare the Dashboard Sheet**

1. Open your file → Insert a **new worksheet** → Rename it **HR Dashboard**.
2. Go to **View tab → Uncheck Gridlines** (for a clean canvas).
3. Insert **company name/logo** (Insert → Pictures or Text Box) in the top-left.

---

## **Step 2: Create KPI Cards (Top Section)**

We’ll build 5 KPIs: Headcount, Avg Salary, Gender Ratio, Payroll Cost, Avg Tenure.

1. **Insert Shape → Rounded Rectangle** → Draw a card.

   * Fill Color: light blue/gray.
   * No outline.
2. Copy-paste → make 5 cards in a row.
3. For each card, add a **formula or PivotTable measure**:

   * **Total Employees**
     Formula:

     ```excel
     =COUNTA(EmployeeID)
     ```

     Or PivotTable → Count of EmployeeID.

   * **Average Salary**

     ```excel
     =AVERAGE(Salary)
     ```

   * **Gender Ratio**

     ```excel
     =COUNTIF(Gender,"Male")/COUNTA(Gender)
     ```

     Format as percentage.

   * **Total Payroll Cost**

     ```excel
     =SUM(Salary)
     ```

   * **Average Tenure (Years)**

     ```excel
     =AVERAGE((TODAY()-HireDate)/365)
     ```

     Format as number with 1 decimal.

📌 Tip: Use **large bold font** (size 18–24) for numbers and **small font** for labels inside each card.

---

## **Step 3: Build Core Charts (Middle Section)**

### **Chart 1 – Department Headcount**

1. Insert PivotTable → Rows = Department, Values = Count of EmployeeID.
2. Insert PivotChart → Clustered Bar Chart.
3. Format: Department names on Y-axis, employee counts on X-axis.

---

### **Chart 2 – Gender Pay Gap**

1. Insert PivotTable → Rows = Gender, Values = Average of Salary.
2. Insert PivotChart → Clustered Column Chart.
3. Format: Show Male vs Female salary comparison.

---

### **Chart 3 – Salary Distribution**

1. Select Salary column → Insert → Statistic Chart → Histogram.
2. Adjust Bin Size (Right-click Axis → Format Axis → Bin Width = 5000).
3. Format: Show how many employees fall within salary ranges.

---

### **Chart 4 – Employee Growth Over Time**

1. Insert PivotTable → Rows = Hire Date (group by Year or Month), Values = Count of EmployeeID.
2. Insert PivotChart → Line Chart.
3. Add Data Labels → Trendline (optional).

---

## **Step 4: Add Filters (Right Sidebar)**

1. Select one PivotTable → PivotTable Analyze → Insert Slicer.
2. Add slicers for:

   * Department
   * Gender
   * Location
3. Insert Timeline → choose Hire Date.
4. Align them vertically on the right side.
5. Right-click each slicer → Report Connections → Check all PivotTables.

---

## **Step 5: Bottom Section – Insights/Notes**

1. Insert Text Box → Title it **Insights**.
2. Write 3–5 bullet points (based on observations from charts):

   * “Engineering has highest headcount.”
   * “Finance salaries are above average.”
   * “Female employees earn 8% less than males.”

📌 This is where you **tell the story**, not just show data.

---

## **Step 6: Final Styling**

* Align everything in a **grid layout** (KPIs top, charts middle, filters right, notes bottom).
* Use **consistent colors**:

  * Blue for Male
  * Pink for Female
  * Green for positive metrics
* Increase font size for KPI numbers (20+).
* Save the file as **HR Dashboard Final.xlsx**.

---

✅ At this point, you will have:

* A **one-page interactive dashboard**.
* Dynamic slicers/timelines to filter by Department, Gender, Location, Hire Date.
* KPIs and charts automatically updating with the dataset.

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **ready-made Excel dashboard template** (pre-built with PivotTables, slicers, and KPIs) so you just plug in your data and it updates automatically?

# Do-It-Along Guide: Visualizing Traditional Food Preferences

You already have the data (`traditional_foods_responses.xls`). Follow these **exact steps**:

---

## 1. Open & Prepare Data

1. Open the Excel file.
2. Check: each student’s name is in one column, and their chosen foods are listed in another column (comma-separated).

We’ll create **helper columns** (one per food) with 1 = liked, 0 = not liked.

---

## 2. Create Helper Columns

1. In row 1, add headers:

   * Roast Maize | Brown Ugali | Fermented Milk | African Tea | Porridge | Sweet Potatoes

2. In row 2 (Roast Maize column), type this formula:

   ```
   =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Roast maize",$B2)),1,0)
   ```

   → Copy this down the whole column.

3. Do the same for each food (change the word inside `"..."`).
   Example for African Tea:

   ```
   =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("African tea",$B2)),1,0)
   ```

Checkpoint ✅: You should now see **1s and 0s** filling under each food column.

---

## 3. Count Likes

At the bottom of each column (say row 25), use:

```
=SUM(C2:C21)
```

(replace `C2:C21` with the actual column range).

Now you have the number of students who like each food.

---

## 4. Make Charts

### (a) Bar Chart

1. Copy the totals into a small summary table:

   ```
   Food              Count
   Roast Maize       X
   Brown Ugali       X
   Fermented Milk    X
   African Tea       X
   Porridge          X
   Sweet Potatoes    X
   ```
2. Select this table → Insert → Column Chart (Bar).

---

### (b) Pie Chart

1. With the same summary table, Insert → Pie Chart.
2. Right-click → Add Data Labels → Show Percentage.

---

### (c) Venn Diagram (Overlap)

Excel doesn’t have built-in Venns, so do this:

1. Decide 3 foods to compare (e.g., African Tea, Brown Ugali, Fermented Milk).
2. Use formulas to count overlaps. Example:

   * Tea + Ugali:

     ```
     =COUNTIFS(F2:F21,1,D2:D21,1)
     ```
   * Tea + Milk:

     ```
     =COUNTIFS(F2:F21,1,E2:E21,1)
     ```
   * All three:

     ```
     =COUNTIFS(F2:F21,1,D2:D21,1,E2:E21,1)
     ```
3. Open PowerPoint → Insert → 3 circles → overlap them → type your numbers inside.

---

## 5. Write Summary

At the bottom of your sheet or in Word, write 3–4 sentences:

**Example template:**
“Out of 20 students, African tea was the most popular (16 students). Brown ugali came second (14) and porridge was least popular (6). Many students enjoyed both tea and ugali (7 overlaps). Only 3 students liked all six foods, showing varied preferences.”

---

## 6. Save & Submit

* Save charts as images or keep inside Excel.
* Put them plus your summary into a Word file called `Takeaway_Task.docx`.

Done ✅
