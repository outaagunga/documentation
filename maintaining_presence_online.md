## 🧭 **1️⃣ DISCOVER (Find the right people daily)**

Use LinkedIn, X (Twitter), or AI-networking apps like **Lunchclub**, **Shapr**, or **Polywork**.

**AI Prompts:**

```
- “List 5 professionals I should connect with today if I want to learn more about [industry/field].”
- “Suggest 3 LinkedIn groups or communities where I can meet people in [profession/location].”
```

✅ **Action Steps:**

* Search 1–3 professionals or groups daily.
* Record names, company, and why they’re relevant in your tracker (Notion, Google Sheet, etc.).

## 💬 **2️⃣ CONNECT (Reach out intentionally)**

Craft personalized connection messages with AI.

**AI Prompts:**

```
- “Write a friendly, professional LinkedIn connection note (under 300 characters) for a [job title] at [company].”
- “Make it sound natural and curious, not robotic.”
```

💡 **Example message:**

> “Hi [Name], I came across your post on [topic]. I’m also exploring [field] and would love to connect and learn from your insights.”

✅ **Action Steps:**

* Send 2–3 tailored connection requests daily.
* Avoid generic “let’s connect” messages — always mention something specific.

## 💭 **3️⃣ ENGAGE (Be visible and valuable)**

Show up on people’s feeds to build familiarity and trust.

**AI Prompts:**

```
- “Write a short (1-sentence) comment appreciating this post: [paste post].”

- “Write a simple LinkedIn post under 100 words showing what I learned in [field/topic].”
```

✅ **Action Steps:**

* Like & comment on 3–5 posts daily.
* Once a week, share your own small post (a takeaway, tip, or lesson).

---

## 💌 **4️⃣ REFLECT & FOLLOW UP**

This phase helps you track progress and build long-term relationships.

**AI Prompts:**

```
- “Summarize my networking actions today and suggest one improvement.”
- “Write a short follow-up note thanking someone for accepting my connection request.”
- “Draft a polite check-in message if I haven’t heard back from someone after 5 days.”
```

✅ **Action Steps:**

* Note new connections or replies.
* Set reminders for follow-ups (every 7–14 days).
* Add personal notes (shared interest, topics discussed).
